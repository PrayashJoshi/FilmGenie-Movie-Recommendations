2258,7,"If this movie has a downside, and many of the reviewers here think it does, I think it tries to be ambitious to a fault trying to top it's predecessor, ""Ocean's Eleven"". This was no more evident than in the gimmick to raise the level of a building by three inches using some underwater hydraulic contraptions. I couldn't follow the logistics of that escapade, much less think it was feasible at all, but the sheer audacity of the idea sounded compelling as all get out. But come on, Linus Caldwell's (Matt Damon) idea for a 'lookie-loo and a bundle of joy' was brilliant; who else would have come up with the idea of Julia Roberts impersonating Julia Roberts in a movie? It was almost as good as Bruce Campbell portraying Elvis Presley who in turn impersonates an Elvis Presley impersonator in 2002's ""Bubba Ho-Tep"". Try wrapping your heard around that one. So Julia Roberts provides the number '12' in this outing, which reunites the usual gang of idiots from the first movie. Good to see Don Cheadle got his own credit for the flick this time around. I will agree that there's a lot to be confused about in the story if you're not paying attention, so you need to be glued to the picture throughout. Noteworthy scenes include Tess's (Roberts) encounter with Bruce Willis (as himself), and Vincent Cassel's turn as a slow motion break-dancer doing the laser field jump.  In the end, the caper turns out to be almost secondary to the zaniness involved in all of this. None of it's believable at all, but what was believable about ""Ocean's Eleven"" when you come right down to it? Leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the flick for the camaraderie and fun involved with the Ocean crew. It's easier that way.

Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit! George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel! Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script. Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever. Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again. George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.

What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it! Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script? George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it! Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that. George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.

2261,-1,"Three years after Ocean's Eleven the gang's all back for more in this sequel. This time around the elusive group of thieves and con artists reunite and travel abroad to Europe to pull off another elaborate heist after vengeful casino mogul Terry Benedict (García) tracks them down looking for reimbursement. Little do they dream that they'll face stiff competition from a self-proclaimed criminal mastermind (Cassel) who's determined to try and upstage them. The latest in a long line of tepid Hollywood sequels; the cast may have had fun making this film but that doesn't mean the audience will as it drags on for over two hours with endless story lulls, self-conscious humor, and banal dialogue.

2263,6,"The 2001 remake of Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a good adventure, with action, comedy and thriller in an updated screenplay. When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (""Full Frontal""(2002); ""Solaris""(2002)). My vote is six.

2268,4,"I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox ",0.7857142857142857,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,i enjoyed oceans i thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction however i was disappointed with this film dont get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt catherine zeta jones george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh however the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up the camera work wasnt as innovative as it was in the first movie either whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music wasnt particularly memorable the screenplay also wasnt as witty or as fun and the film felt anti climatic at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction so much potential but really a missed opportunity bethany cox

2271,1,"Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said, 'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot. However, if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, 'look, I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates, how about it?' the studio writes a cheque. We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash, and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow. The film does, however, include the most shameful moment of both Julia Roberts' and Bruce Willis' careers, which is a cinematic gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much the cheque will be. Ah well, to be fair, I'd have done it for the cash, so I suppose I can't really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story, but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards...I feel like I paid to go to the party, but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo!

2273,6,"A few years have passed since Danny Ocean's band of thieves robbed Terry Benedict's casino in Las Vegas, now he has tracked them all down and he wants his money back with interest. Obviously most of the money has been spent; if they are to avoid being killed they will have to steal more within a fortnight. Since they are too well known in the United States they head to Europe and set about planning a job which has been given them by a contact. Their do the job but find somebody has got there before them and left a message. Danny immediately realises that this thief is the person responsible for telling Benedict where everybody was. The other thief is 'The Night Fox', a French master thief who sees himself as Number One. Danny meets him and they make a bet; each will try to steal a Faberge egg that is due to be exhibited in Rome; if Danny's gang gets it the Night Fox will pay their debts; if they lose Danny will acknowledge that The Night Fox is the better thief and Benedict will have his revenge! If that wasn't enough Europol agent Detective Isabel Lahiri, who had previously dated Danny's partner Rusty is hunting the gang and the Night Fox. The previous film was a fun caper movie; with a bunch of thieves working together to rob a single 'impossible' target this sequel has plenty of fun moments but it is too messy. Here we have two robberies, a rival thief determined to beat them, a cop who one of the team dated and the knowledge that if they fail Benedict will have them killed. There are some good jokes and at one point is gets very Meta as Danny's wife Tess, played by Julia Roberts, tries to pass herself off as Julia Roberts and meets Bruce Willis who is playing himself! While there is an obvious threat and at times it looks as if everything has gone wrong for the gang I don't imagine many viewers will think things won't work out for them in the end. The cast, which is almost entirely well known, do a solid job and are clearly having fun.

2274,7,"Oceans 12 has been given a lot of bad press, Some, if not most of it, deserved. However, there is no escaping the fact that this is a very funny and very entertaining movie. The film does have it's bad points though, first of all Andy Garcia reprising his role as Casino Owner Terry Benedict, is hardly given screen time apart for some at the beginning and some at the end, as a result the film is robbed of a really menacing 'bad guy' even though our hero's are in fact villains themselves. With this in mind I cannot help but feel that the trailer is somewhat misleading, as it wrongly portrays Benedict to be a major protagonist in this sequel, when he's there only to flesh out the plot. Three good things about this movie is Matt Damon, Matt Damon and Matt Damon as he is the only person on the screen that is taking his role half seriously, and he's a delight to watch, especially when he takes the reigns when most of his cohorts are incarcerated. Most of the cast from the first film, seems to be there only to tie it in with oceans 11 as Elliott Gould hardly says a thing neither does Carl Riener, and Bernie Mac spends the majority of the movie in a dutch prison and is hardly seen. Clooney and Pitt, don't seem as cool or as smart as in the 1st movie, and the whole team show themselves to be nothing more than frightened children afraid of the boogeyman, when confronted with an irate hotel owner to whom they owe nearly $200 million. So in contrast from the 'who care's who we're stealing from' type of guys we were introduced to a couple of years ago. This is where the disappointment of the movie comes. Catherine Zeta Jones, is introduced as some Interpol type of cop, who conveniently used to have an affair with Pitt's character, and for the first time in ages, she doesn't adopt a phony American accent, which subsequently make this one of her less annoying roles. We are also introduced to a character called 'nightfox' who tries to steal a faberge egg by somersaults, back flipping and dancing over the laser floor sensors, just like erm....Catherine Zeta Jones did in Entrapment. I almost die form Calcium overdose when the movie gets so cheesy to include a scene with Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts, pretending to be Julia Roberts, the cheese continues, when a woman comes to question the group from prison, which, (and quite predictably might I add), turns out to be Damon's Characters Mother. and the mozzarella marathon continues in the clichéd and predictable scene where Jones is reunited with her father. Contrary to the shape my review is taking, I did like the movie, and there was enough shenanigans to keep me chuckling throughout. However, a further sequel would be ill advised as it in no way stands up to the 1st movie. This movie will not win any Oscars, but an award should be given to Casey Afflecks Moustache, for 'best supporting actor in a comedy role' such is it's hilarity.

2275,7,"While there are enough reasons for one to have reservations about calling this a great film, I must admit that I still found it quite decent entertainment. Soderbergh keeps it well paced and entertaining on a visual level, even with some overly shaky photography and awkward freeze frames, plus there is a great plot twist involving Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis later in the film. The best aspect of this crime caper though is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who adds a lot of sparks and a fresh streak to the material. Yes, the film has its downfalls, such as the plot, which is mostly a series of incidents that only work because one does not know what will happen next, and such as Andy Garcia's cardboard acting. The film lacks much depth and does not execute the buddy-buddy aspect as well as the first film did; however it is kind of fun in its own way: mindless amusement with some great visuals, a twisted plot, and credible acting by Zeta-Jones. No, it is not as good as one would expect with Soderbergh at the helm, but neither is it all that bad.

It is strange in that it builds off the original, you would be lost without previous knowledge of Ocean's Eleven, but yet it has an entirely new tone and feeling as well as European look rather than the Vegas glitz of the first movie. I was very happy that all of the originals came back for the sequel. If you like a good action movie that keeps you guessing then this movie is for you. It was very nice to see Brad Pitt's character fleshed out more in this movie.

2278,6,"This movie tries to make the heist more realistic and complex than the one in Ocean's 11, but it fails. In doing so, they made the movie less intriguing and confusing at times.

2279,2,"SPOILER!! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot, and numerous plot wholes. Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who poorly plays someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts, poorly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. During the movie, we repeatedly zoom in, on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve is too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is, we tediously zoom in on the characters, when all of them are in the same room, doing the same thing. Yep, Clooney's eating. Yep, Pitt's eating. Yep, the ""Jew"" is eating. Yep, the geek is eating. Yep, the bodybuilder's eating. Yep, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep--Yep. Yep. Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yep, they're all sitting in cars, bored. Yep, they're all getting arrested, frightened. Yep, they're all being led out of a jail, depressed. But it wasn't until I was home that I realized how badly they'd ""got"" me on this one. This is a heist movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I walked in and set my car keys in the change jar, only then I realized: NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! That's right. It's a heist movie, where nothing gets stolen. Oh, they try. They go to try and steal some boring document or something, from some guy's house (whatever), and it turns out it's already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!), and they screw that up and get arrested. Then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did, and we get all the joy of ""Entrapment"", except this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the fake lasers is... an ugly skinny french guy. Um. But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another movie entirely, which would have been a GREAT movie to watch, had they made that movie. Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack. You heard me... the daring caper, the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student, by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him, and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What??  Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I didn't even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly I'd been robbed-- until I got home.

2282,1,"Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is ""cool"" and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to ""Hello"" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers). Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. Stick with the original.

2283,-1,"I wanted to like this film, I really did. The remake of the old Rat Pack vehicle, Oceans Eleven, was nicely done. There was a compact feel to it and some elegant twists and turns of plot that made for an entertaining escapist movie. In contrast, Oceans Twelve feels bloated, stumbling along with no apparent point in mind. Worse, there's far too much explanation going on. It has been said that if you have to explain a joke, the joke was a dud. Oceans Twelve proves that the same theory holds true for movies. Since the script was perhaps trying to do too many things at once, there was a need to resort to extensive flashbacks to explain what should have been key plot points. Apparently no one wanted to work hard enough to weave those plot points into the script, so they resorted to Gilligan's Island-style flashbacks to reveal key pieces of information that would have made the story much more coherent had those bits of information simply been given to us in the first place. That would have entailed some deft script-writing and, again, it doesn't seem like anyone other than Catherine Zeta-Jones and Matt Damon wanted to work that hard in this film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt spend most of their time on screen trying to out-smirk each other. I'd smirk a lot too if I was being to do as little as each did in this movie. The most annoying bit of contrivance was the ever-so-cutey-pie idea of having Tess Ocean, played by Juila Roberts, of course, pretend to be Julia Roberts. I guess that gave them an excuse to let Bruce Willis add a few smirks of his own to the story. In well-done ""con"" movies, like The Sting or even the Oceans Eleven remake, the viewer is pulled into the heist and knows enough about the con being pulled to enjoy seeing it unfold. In Oceans Twelve, the heist becomes secondary at best, with the story of the actual heists told in flashbacks. From the flashbacks it looks as if they had the makings of a pretty good sequel, but instead of telling us the story of the heist,we got a weak episode of the old TV show ""It Takes a Thief."" Perhaps most annoying feature of this movie were the painfully obvious teases for yet another sequel. When that comes out, I'll pass, but I do have a suggestion. Since they spent so much time telling the story of Oceans Twelve in plot-repairing or plot-supplying flashbacks, why not just tell us how they pulled the heist so that I don't have to sit through two hours of fluff to get there.

Forgive me for giving away scenes of this film, but I cannot properly describe what I love about it without doing so. Everything about this movie is brilliant, and you won't realize that from seeing it only once. By watching it many times with my family, I've found that this film is chock-full or little surprises and ingenious quotes you won't help but remember; from the great gag with Julia Roberts pretending to be herself (including a cameo with Bruce Willis) to the Night Fox's (an excellent character) attempt to steal the artifact Danny and his gang are after, the plot and script are excellent.

2290,4,"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. Imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety. Entertaining? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12. SPOILERS 1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...Julia Roberts?!? A clever twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film. But wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet... 2. The suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the ONLY entertaining part of this movie, we see that the heist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. The past 10 days? A complete waste of your time. BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE...""Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!""

2303,7,"17 December 2004. This robbery caper is dazzlingly funny and entertaining. But the characters in this movie get uneven movie time and one of the great switches at the end of the movie is flat. Yet, it appears that the star-studded cast is having a good time, the Julia Robert's acting role at the end is delightful, the surprise cameo is fun. Overall the script, plot is decent, the required tension and conflict present. This is fun but perhaps unmemorable movie that is a nice holiday treat that is easy to swallow but required some help along with way. Matt Damon is particularly fascinating because of his other movie, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" that offers an amazing contrast in characters, illustrating his acting depth. Oceans 12 is like a cast of super stars having an opportunity to get together, allowing us a glimpse of an ensemble performance with some of the actors being given a bit more screen time, and an invitation for us to join in the romp and display of informal holiday spirits and jollies.

2312,1,"Man I loved Ocean's 11. Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale. What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person?

It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie. With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease... This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one.

2313,9,"Now, the idea itself of continuing with the Ocean's Eleven franchise was a bad idea in the first place. No movie could live up to the success and sheer brilliance of the first, but with a cast like that, and the visionary wonders of Soderberg, I suppose it was worth a try. This time around, the team goes international after Mr. Benedict, the shrak-like Antonio Banderas, gives them two weeks to reapy their debts, with interest. It adds up to around 197 million dollars, which the team cannot put together. They find three high paying jobs, only to discover another, perhaps more talented, thief wishes to compete. His name is the NIghtfox, and he is working with Mr. Benedict (which you will find out later). Now the movie is very different than the first. Not so much a smooth, jazzy flick anymore. The camera is often hand-held, which is new to Soderberg's previous style, but works nicely. The dialouge is funnier than the first movie, but less relevant. Possibly the funniest part in the movie is when the team discuss's why they were called ""Ocean's Eleven"", yet it doesn't move the movie along at all. The interactions between Rusty (Pitt) and Ocean (Clooney) is great. They work very well together. The addition of the two new characters, Isabel (Zeta-Jones) and the Nightfox bring the movie to new hieghts. When in the first movie, Ocean picks this job for Tess (Roberts), this movie moves more with Rusty, as he chooses Amsterdam because Isabel is there. Some of the shots are simply magnificent. When the Nightfox dances through the lasers, and when the incredible Julia Roberts plays...herself. It all just reminds me of what the definition of entertainment really is.

2323,5,"A few years ago, Steve Soderbergh made a clever little heist film. Well, really, he remade a heist film from the '60s. It featured a healthy dose of star power. The remake, that is. Well, so did the original, but most of them are dead now, so he got new ones. Pitt, Clooney, Damon, Roberts, Garcia, etc., etc., etc. And it was all set in Vegas, the self-admitted epitome of hip American glitz. And money, let's not forget the money, because that's what this film is all about. Making money. Stealing it, even. ""Ocean's Twelve"" serves as perfect illustration of the desperation Hollywood must feel when it has a hit film on its hands. How to best milk a new potential franchise, especially one that doesn't have its own set of source materials (i.e. books or comics or video games) to provide the sequels? How to keep a long-stale formula (the crime caper) fresh? Why, just add another star to the mix, shake, stir, and pour into the collective consciousness of the indiscriminate, entertainment-fixated public. Dispose of any logic or believability. Feel free to break the fourth wall, just for the fun of it. Make most of the film one red herring after another. Throw a few more stars into the mix, uncredited, just so the audience can admire the hipness of it all.

2324,-1,"Now, the trick with a sequel to a remake of a lesser movie is this: how to repeat the magic without making it a bland retread of what's been seen before? Well. It's a truth universally acknowledged that when a film revolves around a heist that goes smoothly even when the victim may eventually retaliate, the only thing its sequel do is go the opposite direction: build momentum around another heist that will redeem our pack of thieves from their state of disgrace and send the story off some odd directions with characters who have their own ulterior motives. If you look closely you can actually feel the noose slowly start tightening itself around Danny Ocean's group. Eccentrics pop in and out, never to be seen again, leaving their own mark -- this is a light ballet gliding towards the moment when everything converges, gets messed up... and to say more would be criminal. You have to experience it on your own. See how one of the most ballsy in-jokes involving a certain Oscar-winning actress from one of Soderbergh's earlier films obliquely leads to the denouement where not one, but two double-climaxes -- one frankly hilarious, fraught with its own little family dysfunction, the other sweetly emotional -- virtually sweep the rug off of you.

The ""Ocean's"" movies are there for the purpose of making money. Many critics blame them for this. But if you're honest they are very well made entertainment, that's their purpose and they achieve this with ease. Steven Soderbergh is the man who makes everything look that easy.

2332,-1,"To be honest, I saw this movie back in August at a special advance screening. I was actually so overwhelmed because I got to meet and talk to Steve Soderbergh before and after the film. In my opinion, Soderbergh is one of the few directors whose films I can trust for quality entertainment, intellect, and style. But to review the movie back then would have been unfair, it's like judging the first demo take of the Beatles song ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" before George Martin added the tape loops. So I decided to wait and review the movie after seeing the final cut, and I was actually pleased that I did that, because just like what I've been telling people for four months and will continue to tell people ""Twelve is different that Eleven."" ""Oh, o.k. so it's not good."" Is what most reactions are after I make that comment. ""No, not true,"" I replied. OCEANS TWELVE is different that OCEANS ELEVEN, the same way KILL BILL VOL. 1 was different that KILL BILL VOL. 2. VOL. 1 was the ultimate homage to the films of the Shaw Bros., VOL. 2 was the homage to the Spaghetti Westerns. OCEANS ELEVEN captured the hip and cool feel of the Vegas heyday of the 60's, when Frank, Dino, Peter, Sammy, and Pal Joey ruled the strip. OCEANS TWELVE captures the European feel when Truffaut, Godard, and Fellini were kings of the art house cinemas. OCEANS TWELVE takes place three years after the infamous ""Belligo heist"" when Danny Ocean (Clooney), gathered his crew of men and managed to steal over $160 million dollars from casino Mongol, Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict has tracked Ocean and his entire crew, and the situation has turned into what Danny's wife Tess (Roberts) alerts Danny about Benedict knowing who did the heist, ""the basement is flooded and the lights are out."" So Danny gathers his entire crew back together again: Rusty (Pitt), Linus (Damon), Basher (Cheadle), Saul (Reiner), Ruben (Gould), the ""Mormon twins"" (Affleck & Caan), Yen (Qin), Dell (Eddie Jemison), and Frank (Mac). The first scene when the entire crew are all together manages to create some nice witty in-joke laughs, such as Turk Malloy questioning Ocean, ""and since when was this called 'Oceans Eleven?'"" The problem is that Benedict knows who pulled off the heist three years ago, he's angry and wants all $160 million dollars back, plus three years worth of interest. The problem, Ocean and his crew can't pull off any job in America since their faces are well known. The solution, go overseas to Europe and pull off another heist to payback Benedict. Yet there is still two other problems, first, it turns out that Rusty had a relationship with Isabel (Zeta-Jones) and suddenly left her after she was about to find out the person who pulled off a heist was actually Rusty. Now Isabel is one of the top detectives of the Euro-Pol force for the crime division. Second, there is another master thief Toulour (Cassel), who calls himself ""the Fox"" decides to have some fun of his own with Ocean and his crew. OCEANS TWELVE succeeds the same way OCEANS ELEVEN did, is one of the most enjoyable, witty, and entertaining movies of the year. Yet, like KILL BILL VOL. 2, OCEANS TWELVE is more plot and character orientated. And with OCEANS ELEVEN where the focus of the romance was Danny and Tess; OCEANS TWELVE it focuses on Rusty and Isabel, with some very enjoyable flashback scenes. Soderbergh again has a batting average of Barry Bonds, and hits another home run with this film. His directing is fantastic, capturing the look, mood, and feel of the European heist films such as GRAND SLAM, the original Italian JOB, and TOPKAPI. Such as the pan of the camera to focus on a particular character, the rapid zoom close-up shots, and the freeze shot before cutting to another scene. Yet he blends it well with modern European style with the technology, talk, and fashion of the modern hip world. I mean, I would love to hang out with this crew! I also highly enjoyed the soundtrack music supervised and composed by David Holmes (who also did Soderbergh's OCEANS ELEVEN and OUT OF SIGHT). Holmes did a great job using his very hip-techno mixes and songs and mixing it well with 60's era European artist such as actress/singer Ornella Vanoni, and composer Piero Umiliani. And the performances are fun and enjoyable to watch. It is obvious that all of the cast members had a fun time while making this movie, and it shows. Yet, that doesn't mean that the viewer should be left out, since there are some witty scenes that make a lot of reference to the previous film, the way Linus trying to understand how Danny and Rusty operate, and about the twelfth member of the crew looking like somebody else. While OCEANS TWELVE doesn't have a intelligent or great plot like COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, RAY, or THE INCREDIBLES. It does exactly what it promises. It promises fun, enjoyment, and laughs, and that is exactly what you will get when watching OCEANS TWELVE. This isn't the most intellectual film of the year, but it is the best looking, and one of the most entertaining and best films of this year. Hats off to Soderbergh, Holmes, writer Geoge Nolfi, and the entire cast for OCEANS TWELVE, for making a delightful film! ***** (out of five) ",0.6,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,to be honest i saw this movie back in august at a special advance screening i was actually so overwhelmed because i got to meet and talk to steve soderbergh before and after the film in my opinion soderbergh is one of the few directors whose films i can trust for quality entertainment intellect and style but to review the movie back then would have been unfair its like judging the first demo take of the beatles song strawberry fields forever before george martin added the tape loops so i decided to wait and review the movie after seeing the final cut and i was actually pleased that i did that because just like what ive been telling people for four months and will continue to tell people twelve is different that eleven oh o k so its not good is what most reactions are after i make that comment no not true i replied oceans twelve is different that oceans eleven the same way kill bill vol was different that kill bill vol vol was the ultimate homage to the films of the shaw bros vol was the homage to the spaghetti westerns oceans eleven captured the hip and cool feel of the vegas heyday of the s when frank dino peter sammy and pal joey ruled the strip oceans twelve captures the european feel when truffaut godard and fellini were kings of the art house cinemas oceans twelve takes place three years after the infamous belligo heist when danny ocean clooney gathered his crew of men and managed to steal over million dollars from casino mongol terry benedict garcia now benedict has tracked ocean and his entire crew and the situation has turned into what dannys wife tess roberts alerts danny about benedict knowing who did the heist the basement is flooded and the lights are out so danny gathers his entire crew back together again rusty pitt linus damon basher cheadle saul reiner ruben gould the mormon twins affleck caan yen qin dell eddie jemison and frank mac the first scene when the entire crew are all together manages to create some nice witty in joke laughs such as turk malloy questioning ocean and since when was this called oceans eleven the problem is that benedict knows who pulled off the heist three years ago hes angry and wants all million dollars back plus three years worth of interest the problem ocean and his crew cant pull off any job in america since their faces are well known the solution go overseas to europe and pull off another heist to payback benedict yet there is still two other problems first it turns out that rusty had a relationship with isabel zeta jones and suddenly left her after she was about to find out the person who pulled off a heist was actually rusty now isabel is one of the top detectives of the euro pol force for the crime division second there is another master thief toulour cassel who calls himself the fox decides to have some fun of his own with ocean and his crew oceans twelve succeeds the same way oceans eleven did is one of the most enjoyable witty and entertaining movies of the year yet like kill bill vol oceans twelve is more plot and character orientated and with oceans eleven where the focus of the romance was danny and tess oceans twelve it focuses on rusty and isabel with some very enjoyable flashback scenes soderbergh again has a batting average of barry bonds and hits another home run with this film his directing is fantastic capturing the look mood and feel of the european heist films such as grand slam the original italian job and topkapi such as the pan of the camera to focus on a particular character the rapid zoom close up shots and the freeze shot before cutting to another scene yet he

It is chunky and cutesy, the plot is just a thin veil of stylish pretense, the acting is non-present- that is George Clooney really plays George Clooney, Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt and so on. It is not even interesting to watch for any given segment. Even a fun, cool city like Amsterdam looks boring. It is actually quite amazing that such a big group of big actors, aided by the likes of Vincent Cassel and Eddie Izzard can deliver a film so phenomenally bland. I have never had high expectations of Steven Soderbergh- that cute little film he made in the 80's drove him way, way too long past his directing capabilities. I really saw no reason why he should have any decency to make films after he messed up ""Solaris"", but I guess he was meant to make this turd.

2336,6,"The thefts to build a certain paycheck (with interest) to pay back what Danny Ocean and his crew stole from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) are not as important in the second film of Soderbergh's ""Ocean Three"" as the interactions of the cast (packed with star power in both big and small roles) and the elaborate chicanery the screenplay pulls on the audience (and Vincent Cassel's egotistical, self-assured, bored-in-his-affluence French aristocratic thief, François Toulour, AKA The Night Fox). The Fabergé egg is what Toulour challenges Danny over to determine who is the best among them regarding thievery. Set in Europe, with Danny and company seemingly up against insurmountable odds (there is an eventual imprisonment where the whole team is sitting in a cell together, and The Night Fox actually beats them to a heist after they extend exhaustive efforts to get to the safe), while an intelligent detective (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) is nipping at their heels on every turn (she is a former flame of Pitt's). This sequel just feels like the band got back together to have a good time, while this popcorn plot of ever-present implausibility ultimately features a twist that pulls the rug on all that we watched the previous 120 minutes. I do think it is questionable to basically jerk us around and stage such complex development just to say it was all for naught because the whole time the eleven had the upper hand on Toulour due to ""an ace in their sleeve"" involving someone close to Zeta-Jones (Pitt always seems to offer this aura of confidence, and a Cheshire Cat smile that indicates he has a firm grasp on how his boys will survive their ordeal unscathed). I think the next film fixes what this film lacks: an initiative behind ""the big heist"", giving the team a common goal to seek retribution against a foe (Al Pacino, whereas, Garcia was their target in the first film). Still, I'd lie if I didn't admit that the trick involving how Matt Damon succeeds in getting his team out of a jam thanks to a swerve regarding ""the FBI"" left me amused, as does Bruce Willis' appearance as it related to a ""Julia Roberts scam"". While Damon and Carl Reiner have spirited moments in the film, the rest of the cast, besides stars Clooney and Pitt (and, especially, Zeta-Jones, who gets the same star treatment), never quite get the same chances to shine as they did in the first, or would in the final film, of the series. The scene between Damon (who so desperately wants to be one of the ""top guys"" of the team) and Coltrane, as Clooney and Pitt look on in somewhat closeted embarrassment, in regards to ""absurd poetic jargon"", I thought was hilarious. I think, considering all the locations utilized and the names in the production involved, you can see all the money spent...maybe just not as well as it could have been.

2337,1,"I liked Ocean's Eleven. This sequel was horrible. Why? Because it broke every rule possible about how a movie is done. And the result was not artistic, provocative or special. The result was only a bad amateur movie. Many things were told instead of shown. New characters popped up all the way through to the very last minutes. Things were said and done that was not given a reason or followed up (eg Yen in the bag and why Pitt's character didn't want to talk about why Robert's character looked alike Julia Roberts). The rules was changed all the way through too. The camera movements made me seasick. The concept was so great and could have been a great movie. And with so many pros it could have been done too.

2342,6,"""Ocean's Twelve"" wastes a stellar cast and great locations on a poor follow up to ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001).

In this convoluted mess, our hero not only has to outwit the police but also pit himself against the world's greatest thief.

My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it. The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars. In summary, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.

2349,-1,"I sat for a couple hours after seeing Ocean's Twelve trying to figure out why Soderbergh and gang had made such an outrageous film. Too much of it didn't add up: the ridiculous laser system guarding the egg in the museum and the equally ridiculous way in which it was defeated; the flashbacks containing information that completely undermined the apparent narrative thrust; Julia Roberts' plot twist and the avalanche of seemingly nonsensical and irrelevant self-reference that immediately followed; O12 had me completely stumped. Until I re-interpreted these scenes as clues towards something else: that O12 is not, in fact, a heist movie, but a *satire* of the heist movie. Why else would someone of Sod's stature overstuff the film with clichés, like the enigmatic and debonair master thief, and the colorful and completely trustworthy team of people who would never exist in real life? One character (the woefully underused Eddie Izzard) even overtly mentions that one particular element of the film is a cliché -- but he doesn't say what it is a cliché *of*. Notice all the decoys, impostors, holograms, secret languages... O12 is littered with breadcrumbs, and I'm willing to believe that there was never actually a spec script called ""Honor Among Thieves."" As a heist movie, it falls flat on its face, arguably worse than Hudson Hawk (which suffered more from sheer goofiness overload, rather than bewildering nonsense). It simply does not make sense. How did the Night Fox get into that house in Amsterdam? Conveniently not explained. How did Benedict find all of the Twelve at once? Conveniently not explained. How did Julia Roberts' plot twist work, while Matt Damon is with her but does not experience the same story change? Conveniently brushed off. How in the name of Zeus did a certain someone show up out of the blue while the gang was locked up and help them with a certain problem? How was this individual aware of certain aspects of Isabel Lahiri's paperwork? An outlandish narrative convenience... or a satire of the genre? Why was so little narrative dedicated to convincing the audience of Benedict's extremely vindictive motivation? How else do you explain the obvious expenses the thieves racked up in their very quest to make money? I mean, come on, when Damon and the other two remaining thieves start spouting off all the heist jargon as they try to figure out a contingency plan... it's preposterous. No one talks like that. Maybe I'm reaching. But either way you slice it, O12 is much, much more enjoyable as a *satire* of the heist film. That's the only way I can understand the film. I know why a sequel was made, certainly: The original made over $450 million dollars worldwide, far and away Sod's most financially successful film. Its closest competitor is Erin Brockovich, which made a little over $250M worldwide, and Traffic clocks in at a little over $200M. Successful, certainly, but not blockbusters like O11 was. A sequel was as inevitable as death and taxes. So it occurs to me that Sod decided he might as well have fun with it -- screw with the audience a little, poke fun at the actors themselves (good naturedly), and they still walked away with about $360M. There also might be a meta-commentary going on about American audiences and how little they catch on to stylistic subversion (I am an American myself, for the record) but it's pure speculation. All I can tell you is that O12 simply does not work as a straightforward film and can really only be enjoyable as a satire. There's simply too many outrageous scenes and too many clichés. There are simply too many lines of dialog that only make sense if the whole movie is a genre skewer. It's also much easier on my brain. And I'd like to think that Sod hadn't morphed into a cynical robber baron who no longer cared about making a good movie.

2351,7,"12 is the new 11. What kind of tagline is that? While this movie may have one of the worst taglines ever, it was a sequel to a fun little heist flick called Ocean's 11. While it could have been done a little bit better, Ocean's 11 was a very fun caper movie with a great cast. Ocean's 12 got an even bigger cast, but I did have some skepticism as to the plot. Regardless, it had been three weeks since I had seen a movie in the theatre (as neither Alexander nor Closer was playing and nothing good was out the first week). So is 12 the new 11? Plot: .8/2: Terry Benedict (Garcia) is angry. Since mastermind Danny Ocean (Clooney), problem solver Rusty Ryan (Pitt), rookie Linus Caldwell (Damon), explosives expert Basher Tarr (Chealde), brothers Virgil (Affleck) and Turk Malloy (Caan), millionaire Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), computer nerd Livingston Dell (Jemison), inside man Frank Catton (Mac), grease man Yen (Qin) and old pro Saul Bloom (Reiner) robbed his three casinos out of $160 million in one night, he has been looking for an opportunity to get back, regardless of the fact that he got paid back from insurance. When rival French thief the Nightfox (Cassel), who wants to prove he is a better thief than the 11, gives him their locations, he pays each of them a visit and tells them they have two weeks to pay him back with interest. Tishkoff is the only one who can afford to pay back his share, so they decide to go to Amsterdam to find an opportunity to make some cash quick. Unfortunately, Saul bows out. They meet with Matsui (Coltrane), who gives them a job worth 2.5 million euro and chances to make more if they succeed. Unfortunately, the Nightfox beats them to the punch and Europol gets involved, with the case led by Rusty's former squeeze Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones). Frank, who left a boot print, is quickly arrested and Matsui tells Isabel that Rusty and Ocean are involved. Ocean meets with Nightfox, who tells him that if he can get an Italian Fabergé egg before the Nightfox does, he'll pay off Benedict for him. For all necessary purposes, the plot works well, but there are problems. Much of the plot is easily predictable, aside from a few key points. Most of the 11 get painfully little to do, especially Frank who gets taken out of the movie barely a quarter into it. Linus is the only one who does more than he did in the original. Tess Ocean (Roberts) is left out for a while, but her part in the plot twist near the end is both good for the plot and the comedy. The Nightfox rivalry seems to be right out of Heist Movie 101. There is also a bit about Isabel's father that anyone with half a brain can successfully predict right off the bat. The plot is OK for a sequel, but by making half the cast seem to be there for the sake of being there, it loses some credit. Comedy: 1.2/2: Ocean's Twelve is mediocre as a comedy. It has it's share of good moments, such as the opening sequence, Topher Grace's cameo and Tess' disguise, and really doesn't have any bad jokes, but it fails to use opportunities often. For example, Bernie Mac is a wasted opportunity. He is a great stand-up comic, but they never use him for anything funny. On the other hand, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are still funny. It does have some good moments and thankfully doesn't do anything here badly, it just doesn't try often enough here. Heist: 1.8/2: The actual thefts are great. The only complaint is that not everyone was used. While they may have had another purpose somewhere, Cheadle, Mac, Jemison, Reiner, Gould and Qin are not used to do their areas of expertise in any of the actual thefts. That's 6/11 that don't get to do their job. A little high, huh? Still, the thefts are interesting if not enthralling. Acting: 1.9/2: While having an all-star cast does reduce the believability, it does increase the fun. Damon (The Bourne Identity) is the only one that shines here, playing the wide-eyed rookie Linus. Pitt (Se7en) is still as slick as he was in the original, and Affleck (Chasing Amy) and Caan (Sonny) are good, even though they get few scenes to shine in. Clooney (Solaris) is not nearly as witty as in the first, but he is still the best choice possible for Danny Ocean. Garcia (Godfather III) is menacing in his first few scenes, but disappears through the rest of the movie. Cheadle (Swordfish) still has the funny voice. Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro) is good, but nothing spectacular. Bruce Willis has a hilarious cameo as himself. The cast isn't here to make you believe the characters, but it does add to the fun factor greatly. Entertainment: 2/2: Ocean's Twelve is the kind of movie anyone can enjoy. It's audience encompasses just about everyone. While it won't gain quite as much acclaim as 11, it still is a fun caper flick. Total: 77%: Ocean's Twelve is overall a good movie, but falls short of being as cool or fun as the original. It owes it's credibility thanks to a great cast and a couple smart heists. While I won't say to go see it in theatres unless you really liked the first, this is definitely worth a rental.

2359,5,"Simply put, this is a boring movie. The strength of Ocean's 11 was that it started at point A and it ended at point B, and it did so in a convincing and entertaining matter and threw in a believable plot twist at the end. It was very simply and straightforward. Ocean's 12 is nothing like this. The film is in desperate need of a better editor, as it is so bloated and ponderous that towards the middle of the film, if you've even managed to keep track of who's stealing what from whom and why they're doing it, you won't even care any more. You'll just be begging for the ending.  The film is filled with bizarre camera angles, such as a shot of an incoming airplane that for some inconceivable reason is filmed sideways. There are also some VERY bizarre scenes, such as a scene where Julia Robert's character has to pretend to be Julia Roberts, and a thief break-dances through lasers. However, the biggest flaw of the movie is the absence of a good heist scene. The heist in Ocean's 11 was masterful, and there is nothing in this film that even comes close. I didn't go to see this movie to watch a cop get reunited with her father who happens to be a master thief, I went to see a team of funny people go up against the odds to steal a lot of money. Bottom line: You will hate this movie. Don't waste your money on it.

Hopefully, it will never be considered a black eye on the success of its predecessor. The problem with the movie is its similarity to the first movie. In Eleven, the synergy between George Clooney and Brad Pitt is entertaining. Twelve overuses this relationship. Eleven took the time to explain why so many thieves were necessary during recruitment. Twelve seemed to struggle to fit all of the characters into the plot.

2371,-1,"The ""Ocean's 11"" franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"", a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his ""Ocean's 11"" remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres. While Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"" made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't ""cool"" constantly changing, ""Ocean's 11"" also looks completely neutered, its ""smooth"", ""relaxed"" and ""cool"" cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's ""riches"", ""bling"", ""money"", ""rule breaking"", ""flashy accessories"" and ""bad boy criminality"" (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed. Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. ""I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,"" is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the ""samurai"", second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money. Soderbergh describes his ""Ocean's 11"" as a ""big wind up toy"", and while its designed to be ""just entertainment"", it does fit in with a number of the director's ""heavier"" films (""King of the Hill"", ""Che"", ""Traffic"", ""Eric Brockovich"", ""The Girlfriend Experience""), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, ""to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable"". Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into ""haves"" and ""have nots"", whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings. Soderbergh would release a sequel, ""Oceans 12"", some years later. This one takes the form of a ""con movie"", its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, ""Oceans 13"" in 2007. The villain's name is literally ""Bank"" (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb. 8.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's ""Heist"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Good Thief"", a remake of Melville's genre defining ""Bob The Gambler"".

This is a refreshing twist on heist movies, actually a combination of twists: payback revenge and criminal vs criminal. This qualifies alternative motive to the crimes and because of the high stakes of competing thieves, we certainly get a complex heist. The problem with this movie is that Benedict's move against them is the most interesting part, but is relegated to the beginning of the movie. Most of the thief vs thief action is obscured to hide information from the audience, causing the movie to explain and even re-explain things that have, are, or will happen in the movie which, honestly, just pads the run time without making the movie more entertaining.

2376,9,"Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. Film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of American movies from the 1970s. From looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichés of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either.

2382,-1,This time the con is on the fans! This sequel is specifically made to make easy money and guess what it comes from you! no thought has gone into cooking up a story -no thought has gone into attempting to give any type of direction or even editing - just a bunch of superstar smarty pants have got together to figure out how much their star power can get them in their spare time. Of course since die-hard fans of Oceans 11 (such as myself) will have to see this movie even if it is to just believe how bad it really is its a no brainer for the producers to dish any hogwash onto our plates - its a well thought of commercial strategy but very cold blooded and callous on the fans. Its extremely painful to sit through - the best performance is by Matt Damon in one particular scene which is the highest point the movie ever reaches -I hope they make an Oceans 13 and really think of a nice story this time around as a sort of apology for their bad behavior this time - or bring out an apology to all the fans they conned! ,0.575,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,this time the con is on the fans this sequel is specifically made to make easy money and guess what it comes from you no thought has gone into cooking up a story no thought has gone into attempting to give any type of direction or even editing just a bunch of superstar smarty pants have got together to figure out how much their star power can get them in their spare time of course since die hard fans of oceans such as myself will have to see this movie even if it is to just believe how bad it really is its a no brainer for the producers to dish any hogwash onto our plates its a well thought of commercial strategy but very cold blooded and callous on the fans its extremely painful to sit through the best performance is by matt damon in one particular scene which is the highest point the movie ever reaches i hope they make an oceans and really think of a nice story this time around as a sort of apology for their bad behavior this time or bring out an apology to all the fans they conned

2384,7,"What I mean by that is... the story contains the same vibrant acting as the first one. Although I do think that at times it may have left the track and lost focus. Such as towards the beginning, but overall, I liked it about the same as the first one. Nothing detracts watching this film from watching the first. In fact I think I'll go play the first. Clearly George and Brad are having a great time. Love the scene towards the end with the baseball hat trick. They went all out in having fun. THe moment Brad puts the hat down. phewt George swipes it off the table and all hell breaks loose. Also I think the fact that Julia roberts character pretends to be Julia Roberts... has got to be a Hollywood first. Maybe I'm wrong, but not many movies where one gets to pretend to be oneself. Although I don't like Julia all that much. She was great in the first and she's pretty good in the second . (although for some reason her character isn't shown that much this time. )  And the lovely addition of Vincent Cassel (did I butcher his last name? lol) anyway, that was a great addition. Although I wish he'd play more good guy roles like Crimson Rivers (something was lost when he left Crimson Rivers 2) Jean Reno and Vincent had great Chemistry. He certainly was wicked in Elizabeth though. So I'll have to recommend this sequel to anyone who either enjoyed the first or is a new fan. :) 7/10 Quality: 9/10 (great camera work and editing) Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 7/10 ",-1.0,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,what i mean by that is the story contains the same vibrant acting as the first one although i do think that at times it may have left the track and lost focus such as towards the beginning but overall i liked it about the same as the first one nothing detracts watching this film from watching the first in fact i think ill go play the first clearly george and brad are having a great time love the scene towards the end with the baseball hat trick they went all out in having fun the moment brad puts the hat down phewt george swipes it off the table and all hell breaks loose also i think the fact that julia roberts character pretends to be julia roberts has got to be a hollywood first maybe im wrong but not many movies where one gets to pretend to be oneself although i dont like julia all that much she was great in the first and shes pretty good in the second although for some reason her character isnt shown that much this time and the lovely addition of vincent cassel did i butcher his last name lol anyway that was a great addition although i wish hed play more good guy roles like crimson rivers something was lost when he left crimson rivers jean reno and vincent had great chemistry he certainly was wicked in elizabeth though so ill have to recommend this sequel to anyone who either enjoyed the first or is a new fan quality great camera work and editing entertainment replayable
2385,6,"Sesame Street is having an aneurysm over this movie's slogan: ""Twelve is the new Eleven."" Having nailed the formula down pat with ""Ocean's Eleven""  ridiculously implausible action and pulp coincidences, snide and smarmy rock soundtrack (evoking a Guy Ritchie-ish élan), smash-cuts and wobbling Steadicams, overlapping, smart-ass dialog, and A-List megastars glutting all 70 millimeters of the widescreen  director Steven Soderbergh now hurls ""Ocean's Twelve"" at us like an elitist Upper Class Molotov cocktail and hopes we don't run screaming into the sallow beigeness of our mundane, everyday lives. Filled as it is with man-toys (from Clooney's too-hip instigator, Danny Ocean, to Damon's stuttering novice, Linus, to Pitt's glib Tyler Durden franchise, here named Rusty Ryan) and toy women (the stunningly rapturous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Rusty's ex-sex, Detective Isabel, and the stunningly bland Julia Roberts playing Tess, Ocean's spouse), we find the camera righteously slewing all over creation trying to cram them all in, making for a movie so self-aware of its megastar cheese-wattage that it can't quite get over its own smugness. There is something intrinsically twisted in a society bulked with Middle and Lower Class peons, who would patronize a film centering on the illegal exploits of High Class thieves, tolerating the hijinks of these outlandishly enabled hedonists for the very fact that they are too rich to be stealing for necessity in the first place. It's good to be a man-toy. The megastars quickly exposit why they should all go to Europe for this film (besides to annoy those of us trying to EARN a living): the casino entrepreneur whom they heisted in ""Ocean's Eleven"", Benedict (Andy Garcia, foreboding as always), has located them all and craves payback  with big vig  so off they traipse to heist Continental rich men for the funds. ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"" this ain't  the rich robbing the rich to pay the rich. See, Lower Class peons, how it all works out for everyone?  Thus does malarkey ensue. When their first Euro heist requires a cable shot that cannot be made from one building to another due to the second building being too low, instead of chipping away at the ramparts of the first building, or taking a shot from a *lower* window, these monumentally-thick thieves opt to *raise* the second building 18 inches (via underwater pylon-jacks) to achieve their goal. If you sat in your seat without batting an eye during this incomprehensibly-gratuitous sequence (which would have realistically put Ocean's crew so far into the red financially that they'd be selling their suave man-behinds in Amsterdam just to pay for the plane tickets home), the rest of the plot would make complete sense. If, on the other hand, you are not in the 1-percent of super-thieves currently trawling the French Riviera billionaire circuit, or if you have not the faintest clue where to purchase building-raising pylons with digital leveling readouts, the plot will become one sad contrivance after the next, magically twisting in on itself whenever it wants to pull another double-con on its audience. In touch with reality about as solidly as Michael Jackson, the movie's prime directive is eventually established - a thievery competition between Ocean's Eleven and acclaimed Euro thief, the Night Fox (Vincent Cassell, suitably Continentally Charming-yet-Treacherous). The competition's Prize is housed in a museum room rife with laser fields  which begs the question: when is a security company going to produce a laser field that actually encloses the object it is guarding? From ""Entrapment"" (where Zeta-Jones herself breaches a laser field), to ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" laser fields only exist in movies to illustrate how pragmatically they can be breached, and are as much a hindrance to super-thieves as geriatric rent-a-guards.  With a climactic soundtrack lifted from Iron Butterfly's ""In A Gadda Da Vida,"" the grand double-triple-con goes into effect  with Julia Roberts suddenly playing Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis suddenly turning up for added camera-slewing, and everyone else getting arrested and clanked into a cell, isolated from any *real* perps lest their luscious posteriors suffer the brunt of caged man-lust. Ultimately, Ocean and the Night Fox face off to explain to the addled audience (replete with crash-cut visuals) the obvious discrepancies and plot holes that we wanted to slap the screenwriter over. After the Night Fox gets his Bond-Villain on, revealing his methods in heisting the Prize  including a scene of break-dancing through that vaunted laser field - Ocean accounts what *really* transpired during the heist. It's suddenly ""Rashomon"" with man-toys. As in this film's predecessor, seems like a heist can only be pulled off successfully in past tense. Clooney should wipe that smirk off his face before someone slaps it off. As for the two women in the mix (Isabel, out to bust Rusty's taut butt, and Tess, incessantly prodding Ocean to renounce thievery) - seems they were only hounding their men until a big enough heist brought in enough income to reconcile them with Crime being a viable vocation. The final scene sees all these megastars partying around a poker table  which speaks volumes about the vapid principles that the women supposedly stood on. In moving out from under the daunting yet protective shadow of the Sinatra-based ""Eleven,"" Soderbergh's ""Twelve"" was less financially-successful than its predecessor. In deference to this genre's trend, all the bombast, neo-realism and implausibility must necessarily be ratcheted up on successive sequels, thereby we can rest assured that, although Sesame Street may cringe in anguish, ""Thirteen will be the new Zero.""

2386,7,"A lack of pretension can cover a multitude of sins- even the lack of a plausible script. Such is the premise that Ocean's Twelve, the sequel to Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven remake of the Rat pack classic 1960s caper film, must have been pitched at studio executives with. Simply put, never has a film about less, with less characterization and more smug mugging for the camera ever worked better. There were a plethora of such films in the 1960s, both American and European, and even Japanese, but none with the star power this film has. Style, on very rare occasions, can trump substance, and this film is that exceptional one that proves that substance usually is king. OK, what of the plot? In the first film Danny Ocean (George Clooney)and his crew stole $160 million from the casino of a big time casino owning mobster named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). This film opens three years later, with all eleven thrives hunted down and given a deadline with which to pay back the money with interest, or die. Of course, there are plot holes galore. The whole set up is untenable, and the fact that such smooth operators would so easily expose themselves is ridiculous. Still, there are some really funny scenes of Bernie Mac in a massage, Rusty (Matt Damon) as a lap dog, and assorted other funny scenes. Only Ocean manages to escape such a threat- but not for long, as he re-teams with the others to make things right.What I find amazing is how many reviewers panned this film. It reminded me of the roasting the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla got; as if a film about a big lizard stomping on New York would or should have been Oscar caliber? This is why I started off talking about pretense, and its ability to salvage potentially bad films. In this case, it works, and so does the film. Now, if Ocean's Thirteen were smart it would just focus all on Ms. Jones. Sometimes pretense has its charms!

2389,1,"This had more vitality and stars than the first. But ended up being lower than it. First off, the script. Oh that script. It suffers from too many characters, exhausting twists, and incredible silliness. It even whines about a daughter and her lost father, a loving wife and her thief husband who she forgives lately for no apparent reasons, while there is no characterization or whatsoever form the start! The irony of having (Pitt, Zeta-Jones, Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Willis, Mac, Cheadle, Coltrane, Gould, and Finney) with this script kills me. Most of them have no necessity at all. For instance; what Gould did do else talking about defecation?, what Cheadle did do else moving around the minim replica?, what Mac did do else being in jail for all the time?!!, and so on and on. Aside from a certain sense of bore, it created also such a frustration that made us really feel ""HOW WASTED!"". It leaves you with numerous questions; who was that wealthy American, the faceless one in the flashback on the yacht, that wanted the gang to be stopped? Why Finney, as the greatest thief, agreed with his pupil (Nightfox), then double-crossed him later? If Ocean's 11 robbed the egg earlier, why they went to pull off the 3D trick with the fake Julia Roberts plan? (brilliant way to mark them ALL TOGETHER in the police files!), and if that was done for going to jail with Clooney, so Demon's mom gets them out, then why bother yourself using that strange plan B?, just send that mom to get him out! And if Ocean's 11 went to rob (Nightfox)'s palace while they don't know about his hidden cameras, then they're stupid.. exactly like this movie! Obviously, that was for the sake of twists that assume being ""smart"" or ""smarter than you dear viewer"", while they're wholly not. As you see, it moves from the relaxing ""don't think"", to the shameful ""brainless"", to the insulting ""you're brainless""! I hate the movie makers' confidence that they can make dumb errors and lazy points and get away with it in the name of coolness, post-modernism, whatever. Can anybody tell me why Mac's character was in jail for? Or what did Zeta-Jones's character say to Coltrane's in the interrogation room to break him? Speaking about that nasty confidence, the dialogue is SO PAINFUL. They thought when very unfunny lines are being said by cool stars then they would be funny. Well, that's the definition of ridiculousness, which this movie has MUCH of it. Review some with me: ""If you're gonna ask if you can ask me a question, give me time to respond. Unless you're asking rhetorically, in which case the answer is obvious - yes."", ""Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? / He opens the second floor window every now and then. / What does that mean? / It means he opens the second floor window every now and then."" And the ugliest ""..That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable"". I didn't have that dryness out of the worst sitcoms! Further, thinking that making fun of fake Julia / real Julia, and useless Bruce Willis, led to terrible sequence. While not finishing the jokes is always bad, the movie so foolishly savors it to the max (the lost catchphrase of the stand up comedian, the talk about Willis's movie scene..). Saw the moment in the bar with Clooney and Pitt laughing a long, so detestable, laugh at something that we don't know! Did they think that when these 2 Hollywood stars do it, then we must laugh as well??!! I knew later that George Nolfi, one of the main writers here, wrote a never made John Woo movie named ""Honor Among Thieves"", then Warner Bros. Asked him to *adjust* it for the Ocean's characters. According to what I watched, he made a chock-full messy mix. Remember fine, that guy is the same one who wrote (Timeline - 2003), (The Sentinel - 2006), and (The Bourne Ultimatum - 2007); namely some of the most confident shoddy scripts I have ever seen! To burn it more, let's talk about the direction. Clooney said in a TV interview that the first Ocean movie was a salute to the 1970s heist movies (Huh?!), and the second one is a salute to the 1960s ones (Double the Huh?!!). Is it because the second was shot in Europe? Actually Steven Soderbergh was more 70s in the second, knowing the weird angles, shooting outdoors, the hand held camera, etc. At any cost, he tried to make the Hollywood stuff yet with different feel, using a flavor from the realistic cinema. However, the outcome is shockingly tasteless. We didn't enjoy the stars through image or basically a good script. And it isn't an enjoyment on the level of being artistic either. I only enjoyed the laser beams dance, with the eastern music of Thé à la Menthe, performed by La Cautionit, as the one thing that could be re-watched. (Ocean's Twelve) shows a new type of awfulness where endless colors are thrown in sterile vacuum. It alleges being intelligent, funny, cool, and light while it's dumb, unfunny, cold, and heavy. I believe in entertainment it's supposed to make a dazzling illusion, not being full of illusion yourself. This movie is like its (Nightfox); so rich yet with tons of vanity, thinks the job is done, while it's not. It was produced with $110,000,000, to gain $125,531,634? I think it deserved less! PS: When Willis as Willis met Roberts as fake Roberts playing the real Roberts (dizzy!), then asked her about Danny; you have to think was that for breaking the fourth wall (as if Willis ran into the filming of an ""Ocean"" sequel, and asked about Clooney's character), or was Willis a party in the scheme already?? The thing is ""Danny"" is Roberts's husband's name in the movie, and - after little reading - I knew that it's also the nickname of Roberts's husband, Daniel Moder, out of the movie! Anyhow, it was the top of this movie's dullness, and one of the most confusing moments in movie history!

2390,9,"This is a timeless movie that can be watched over and over. I have lost count of the times I've watched Ocean's Twelve on DVD - it is pure, engaging entertainment, a 2000's version of a 60's movie. Audrey and Carey are lurking just around the corner. There is something plain likable about a bunch of desperate thieves who have a conscience, and actors who buy into the dynamic. The dialog is snappy, the situations are believable, if not entirely plausible, but not absurd either. I liked Ocean's Eleven, this one with the European connection is classier, and funnier. The music is upbeat, and attractive, like almost everything else about the production. Actually, I can't think of anything negative about it - maybe a few scenes look fudged, but that is only apparent after looking at it repeatedly. The plot switches are most satisfying.

2393,-1,"You can't go further wrong by walking into the cinema expecting O12 to be a continuation of O11. That's why so many people are disappointed. O11 had a most stylish closing. Against the dream-like glow of the fountains in the distant background, Ocean's gang (10 of them) is filmed leaning against the stone railing of an open terrace gazing into the misty unknown while savoring their sweet victory. None of them speak in the enchantment of the almost moody background music. Then, slowly, one by one, they turn around and walk away. Such a beautiful ending. (The really final scene with Rusty and Tess picking Danny up at the jail is just an awkward tail). That should be the end. No sequel. The opening of O12 pronounces loudly that this is NOT a sequel. While O11 is a crime caper, O12 is a witty comedy constructed around the frolic fun of the reunion of the characters. The scene with every 4-letter word ""beeped"" off by a malfunctioning computer sets the tone. This cleverness is sometimes overdone. Danny Ocean's quick allusion to his ""second third anniversary"" at the jewelry shop at the very beginning is fun, but to have it repeated at the end, not only once but twice, is getting rather tedious, as if the audience needs hearing aids. The fun carries on (at least for those who realize that this is not a heist movie) and just when you think that the laughs have been exhausted, Soderbergh throws at you this Julia-playing-Tess-playing-Julia bit, which is just fantastic. You don't know how fantastic it is until you hear somebody's line about Tess not having to do much because Julia sometime just laughs in front of the reporters and doesn't say anything, and then you realize that the person standing there listening to this with a straight face is not only Tess, about also JULIA! This reality-turned-inside-out is seen again and again. We have Linus Caldwell asking for a bigger role in the caper, but Matt Damon actually asking for a smaller role in the movie! There's also referencing for those who like that sort of thing, such as Vincent Cassel's disgustingly carried-away stunt with the moving blue laser beams referencing Catherine Zeta-Jones's graceful maneuver through the stationery red laser beams in Entrapment. Behind the scene, this is also a fun party, from what I've heard and read. It seems that the cast of O11 had so much fun making it that they just loved every minute doing it again in this sequel that is not really a sequel. To this already impressive cast is added Zeta-Jones and Cassel mentioned before, plus versatile veterans Robbie Coltrane and Cherry Jones, and even uncredited cameos Albert Finney and Bruce Willis. Although belonging to a very different genre, Ocean's Twelve is just as much a Christmas party as Love Actually was last year.

That aside, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone.

2400,1,"I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term ""story"" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times. The actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon, Clooney and Pitt aren't brilliant either. To be honest I really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie. === May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess.

2402,7,"I saw this only now because I heard it was bad. Not being the biggest fan of the first I was fine skipping it. But over the years I've learned not listen to people and to decide for myself. And the movie was pretty much how they said but it wasn't bad. I really liked the story and the way it was shot was incredible. Soderbergh has the ability to take a straight forward scene and make it interesting by the camera angle. Choosing when to introduce characters or elements into a scene. The opener is a good example. Just because of what you are seeing while CZJ is talking you know what's going on. The first half is great and then unfortunately the second half kinda looses it. It gets too convoluted and messy. I get what they were going for, a heist without the heist. But there's so much going back and forth during crunch time that it's almost a mess. And ultimately it's very unsatisfying because they explain the climax of the story and it's over. There's no real thrill of suspense or anything. And we don't really care about CZJ and her dad at all. I give them the A for effort. I miss when big Hollywood movies would take a risk sometimes and not play it safe every single time. What works in the movie works very well. I didn't realize that the movie wasn't going to land where intended till towards the end, so there's that. The humor was good and the plot was really good.

So Clooney and friends have to pay back Andy Garcia for all the money they stole in the first flick. The gang head to Europe to plan some heists. They plan and plan but Europe is just not as much fun to steal from as Vegas. Their hearts weren't into it so they just fumbled around Italy and had some laughs.

2407,6,"""Ocean's Eleven"" was one of the best made ""caper"" films to be made in the past twenty-five years (my opinion). It was smartly made, with an interesting, handsome and talented group of actors. A wonderful script, updated by Ted Griffin. Steve Soderbergh kept the action and story tight, and gave the film a first class ""look"". It went on to garner much critical and commercial success, and provided a hit vehicle for Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, that neither one had had in the previous few years. Talk of a sequel was guaranteed. Anticipation was high, for this surely seemed to be a franchise that could be tapped every couple of years. Sorry to say that ""Ocean's Twelve"" is somewhat of a mess, and too much of a disappointment. The problem is with the difficult to follow screenplay by George Nolfi. I don't mind jumping back and forth in time to tell a story, but there are too many holes in the story that ask you to wait until the end of the movie for resolution. The problem with having so many holes in the story, is that it makes you realize how flimsy the screenplay as a whole is. While it's good to see everybody back in this film, there seems to be less chemistry amongst the leads. Clooney and Pitt do not have any interesting scenes with each other here that makes you believe their characters are still friends., which was one of the things in the first film that made them so endearing. Garcia is largely wasted in what is little more than a cameo role. Roberts, who was pregnant at the time the film was made, has little to do, and the rest of the cast is wasted. The only one who comes off well is Zeta-Jones, who is absolutely beautiful. There are some moments in the film that seem to be there only to let the cast and Sonderbergh show how much fun they had on their little vacation in Europe. An idiotic plot device that centers around Robert's real-life celebrity doesn't work, nor does an appearance by Bruce Willis. There are also an endless number of individual shots of each member of the gang. Oh look, here they are all walking out, one by one, of a building. Here they are, one by one, getting caught. And here they are again, one by one looking at each other. Not very interesting. And lastly, too much of the movie is explained after the fact. One of the best parts of the first film was to see how the caper went down as it happened. Here, it's all presented as a follow-up to the events. Not good. ""Ocean's Twelve"" is in the end, a bitter disappointment. I wish I hadn't seen it and could just have preserved the memory of the first film in my mind.

2408,6,"Following 'Oceans Eleven' was always going to be difficult, and unfortunately 'Twelve' failed to excel. A lack of differentiation between the two made it slightly tedious, missing originality and new concepts. Soderbergh offers the same tense, smooth heist attempt but changes the location, the prize and the form of the theft from 'Eleven'. The cast is relatively the same from 3 years ago with Catherine Zeta-Jones performing a top role in the film. It is worth noting where we left off in the last film, with Benedict's bodyguards subtly following Danny, Rusty and Tess. Turning to the beginning of the screenplay, Terry Benedict locates all eleven members of Danny Ocean's crew, demanding they return the $160 million they stole from the casinos plus $38 million interest. Short by half, the group schemes to stage another heist in Amsterdam to avoid problems with U.S. authorities. They are tipped off by an informant named Matsui about the location of the first stock certificate ever. After a complex series of schemes, they find the document has already been stolen by the ""Night Fox"", another master thief. Europol Detective Isabel Lahiri is called in to investigate the theft and realises that she gave Rusty the idea of how to solve a complication of the heist with a description of a similar burglary earlier during their relationship. Surprising the group at their accommodation, she warns them they cannot beat the Night Fox or his mentor, the mysterious master-thief ""LeMarc"", both of whom excel in practicing the ""long-con"". She has been hunting for years. Instantly we are confronted with a reason to plan and execute another heist for the group, however not for their own gain, but to repay Benedict. Danny and his gang discover the Night Fox is François Toulour, a wealthy French baron who has a villa in Lake Como. Toulour invites Danny to his villa and reveals that he had hired Matsui to inform the crew about the certificate in order to arrange the meeting with Danny. Toulour is upset that LeMarc did not describe him as the best thief in the world and challenges Danny to steal the Fabergé Imperial Coronation Egg. If Danny and his crew win, Toulour will pay off the debt to Benedict. Danny and his gang begin to plan an elaborate heist to swap the egg for a holographic recreation, but the engineer hired by the group accidentally tips off Lahiri to their presence, and she captures all of the crew except Linus, Tarr, Turk, and Saul. Linus comes up with a second plan involving Danny's wife, Tess, posing as a pregnant Julia Roberts in order to get close to the egg and swap it. They are foiled by Lahiri and a coincidentally present Bruce Willis, and the rest of the group are captured. Lahiri is told that they are to be extradited to the United States. Linus is chosen first to be interrogated by the FBI agent assigned to collect them. It turns out that she is his mother, who organises the release of the whole gang. She points out to Lahiri that Lahiri will face only retribution for forging a signature on a Europol form to obtain the necessary arrest warrants for Ocean's gang. It all seems very convenient that Linus' mother is able to free the gang and allow the heist to be completed. Some time later, Danny and Tess return to Toulour's estate where he reveals his glee at their failure. Toulour explains that he stole the egg at night using his agility and impressive dancing skills to evade its heavy security. Toulour's celebration is short-lived when Danny reveals that his group stole the real egg while it was in transit to the museum, and Toulour realises that they were tipped off by LeMarc. A flashback reveals that Danny and Rusty has met LeMarc earlier when he revealed his confidence trick intended to humiliate Toulour, and at the same time, to restore to himself the Fabergé egg that he had stolen years ago and returned his wife's wishes. Toulour is forced to admit Danny won the bet and gives him the money for the debt. They pay back Benedict and promise not to perform any more heists in his casinos as Toulour is in the background spying on Benedict. Rusty takes Lahiri to a safe house that he claims has been lent to him by LeMarc. She is reunited with her father, who is revealed to he the man she has been pursuing for years: LeMarc. Despite its clever reverse and the connection between Lahiri and LeMarc. Ocean's Twelve unfortunately didn't live up to high expectations. The heist is clever and is impressive tying in with LeMarc, a man who is regarded in myths as the greatest thief to ever live, so good that nobody knows if he exists, or ever existed. George Clooney and Brad Pitt do compensate for the poor watch with their collectedness and composure and ultimate intelligence to pull off and execute yet another heist in remarkable fashion. The film, lasting for 125 minutes, misses any real fluidity and doesn't entice its audience as much as 'Eleven' did. No anticipation or climax makes the watch less gripping and thrilling, which we all want to experience when watching a 'classic' theft. Numerous transitions in the film felt lazy and thoughtless meaning that the heist was convenient and somewhat lucky. Not on the same level as 'Eleven'. Overall very disappointing.

the beginning of the screenplay terry benedict locates all eleven members of danny oceans crew demanding they return the million they stole from the casinos plus million interest short by half the group schemes to stage another heist in amsterdam to avoid problems with u s authorities they are tipped off by an informant named matsui about the location of the first stock certificate ever after a complex series of schemes they find the document has already been stolen by the night fox another master thief europol detective isabel lahiri is called in to investigate the theft and realises that she gave rusty the idea of how to solve a complication of the heist with a description of a similar burglary earlier during their relationship surprising the group at their accommodation she warns them they cannot beat the night fox or his mentor the mysterious master thief lemarc both of whom excel in practicing the long con she has been hunting for years instantly we are confronted with a reason to plan and execute another heist for the group however not for their own gain but to repay benedict danny and his gang discover the night fox is françois toulour a wealthy french baron who has a villa in lake como toulour invites danny to his villa and reveals that he had hired matsui to inform the crew about the certificate in order to arrange the meeting with danny toulour is upset that lemarc did not describe him as the best thief in the world and challenges danny to steal the fabergé imperial coronation egg if danny and his crew win toulour will pay off the debt to benedict danny and his gang begin to plan an elaborate heist to swap the egg for a holographic recreation but the engineer hired by the group accidentally tips off lahiri to their presence and she captures all of the crew except linus tarr turk and saul linus comes up with a second plan involving dannys wife tess posing as a pregnant julia roberts in order to get close to the egg and swap it they are foiled by lahiri and a coincidentally present bruce willis and the rest of the group are captured lahiri is told that they are to be extradited to the united states linus is chosen first to be interrogated by the fbi agent assigned to collect them it turns out that she is his mother who organises the release of the whole gang she points out to lahiri that lahiri will face only retribution for forging a signature on a europol form to obtain the necessary arrest warrants for oceans gang it all seems very convenient that linus mother is able to free the gang and allow the heist to be completed some time later danny and tess return to toulours estate where he reveals his glee at their failure toulour explains that he stole the egg at night using his agility and impressive dancing skills to evade its heavy security toulours celebration is short lived when danny reveals that his group stole the real egg while it was in transit to the museum and toulour realises that they were tipped off by lemarc a flashback reveals that danny and rusty has met lemarc earlier when he revealed his confidence trick intended to humiliate toulour and at the same time to restore to himself the fabergé egg that he had stolen years ago and returned his wifes wishes toulour is forced to admit danny won the bet and gives him the money for the debt they pay back benedict and promise not to perform any more heists in his casinos as toulour is in the background spying on benedict rusty takes lahiri to a safe house that he claims has been lent to him by lemarc she is reunited with her father who is revealed to he the man she has been pursuing for years lemarc despite its clever reverse and the connection between lahiri and lemarc oceans twelve unfortunately didnt live up to high expectations the heist is clever and is impressive tying in with lemarc a man who is regarded in myths as the greatest thief to ever live so good that nobody knows if he exists or ever existed george clooney and brad pitt do compensate for the poor watch with their collectedness and composure and ultimate intelligence to pull off and execute yet another heist in remarkable fashion the film lasting for minutes misses any real fluidity and doesnt entice its audience as much as eleven did no anticipation or climax makes the watch less gripping and thrilling which we all want to experience when watching a classic theft numerous transitions in the film felt lazy and thoughtless meaning that the heist was convenient and somewhat lucky not on the same level as eleven overall very disappointing

Now Clooney and the gang must make $190 million over a two week period as they travel to Amsterdam and Rome to pull their heists. Along for the ride is a sexy detective (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has a past with Pitt and a world-class criminal (Vincent Cassel) who wants to prove to the underworld that he indeed is the greatest international thief. Totally silly and over-exaggerated, but enjoyable nevertheless. Director Steven Soderbergh uses a proved formula and a top-notch cast to get his wild points across.

Of the 3 this was the most fun and surprising- Not for the plot and suspense but mostly for the cast and the enjoyment of hanging out with the gang for a while. Even though the plot is been there done that with nothing really exciting and almost slick enough in spots to put you to sleep... on the whole 12 was refreshing and fun. I really enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor here. It was fun to see Catherine Zeta Jones as a foil to Pitt. Although unbelievable the plot had enough twists to make it enjoyable -again mostly all tongue in cheek and if you take it that way and are not looking for a real suspenseful heist movie but more of a comedy this one is the winner. ,-1.0,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,i watched oceans years ago and it kind of bored me but it has been a decade so i decided to watch it again and then watch oceans and of the this was the most fun and surprising not for the plot and suspense but mostly for the cast and the enjoyment of hanging out with the gang for a while even though the plot is been there done that with nothing really exciting and almost slick enough in spots to put you to sleep on the whole was refreshing and fun i really enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor here it was fun to see catherine zeta jones as a foil to pitt although unbelievable the plot had enough twists to make it enjoyable again mostly all tongue in cheek and if you take it that way and are not looking for a real suspenseful heist movie but more of a comedy this one is the winner
2417,6,"I have read just two comments here because I didn't want to get affected by the general opinion. I think if you enjoyed the first part because of the sharpness with which the team carries out the heist and the smoothness with which everything gels together, then you just might be disappointed by the sequel. On the other hand, if you found it brilliant more because of the actors, then Ocean's Twelve might work for you. I belong to the former category and I couldn't help feeling exasperated at times while watching this movie. The zing's just not there! **Might contain spoilers ahead** There are some really great scenes, with my favorite being the whole Bruce Willis cameo. The Julia Roberts as Julia Roberts thing was really funny. The story in itself is great. Brad Pitt gets more screen space at the expense of Mr Clooney. Catherine Zeta Jones does a competent job. Matt Damon is hilarious as the nervous guy. The rest of the cast is fairly decent too. But the screenplay misses. And that costs the movie a lot.

2420,-1,"The key to understanding Ocean's Twelve and enjoying it is to realize that this film does not try to be a film about a bunch of gangsters pulling off a heist. It is a film about style. When it is explained in the end how they pulled off their heist, we understand that almost everything they did in the last third of the movie had no reason at all. They just did it for the style points and to make their adversary's defeat even more bitter. In my book, that's style. The movie flows freely, never really climaxing, watching beautiful people with beautiful voices, dressed in the height of fashion. It is amusing, not really funny except occasionally, not really suspenseful, but it is permeated by the feeling that everyone involved had a lot of fun - and it practically oozes out of the screen infecting the audience. It seems as if Soderbergh thought that he had done ""his heist-movie"" in Ocean's Eleven, so now he made the ""meta heist-movie"".

THis time however there is an added twist as Terry Benedict wants his money back and a cop is hot on their trail. One thing I liked about the first film was the way Soderburg was able to mesh together all eleven characters to form a cohesive and fun story. Sadly however he was unable to duplicate it here. It seemed like that only a few characters that were getting substantial screen time. Yes, they were all back but it seemed like it wasn't necessary. All that top billing for guys like Garcia and Mac for bit parts. I also found the story not as enthralling as the first. Whereas the story of the first felt original and exciting this was more bland. It just didn't have the same punch as the first. The first was a really fun I also found it a little confusing at times and only really fully understood the movie after much discussion with those who have seen the movie. Well compared to the first movie there were a lot of really funny moments. Whereas the first was more serious this was a little more light. Well i'm really hoping they put this franchise to bed.

And oh, let's not forget the imaginative and brilliant idea to write a scene where Julia Robert's character pretends to be Julia Roberts.

I bought a ticket to the movie in hopes to see another brilliant heist but instead I was stuck with three that lasted only a minute or so.

I don't have the time to explain why I love this European Crime Caper Con movie. Where 11 was a finely tuned machine of a movie, 12 had been designed to feel real, magical, but completely real. When Soderbergh does his one for the studio to make up for the (beautiful) bomb Solaris, he really still imbues it with his wit and verve and spirit and unique charm and skills.

2435,6,"Firstly lets get the niggly bits out, most review's you've read of this movie have probably been bad, and the main reason for this is the smugness and arrogance displayed by the cast in having a good time making the movie, you have Hollywood A-list celebrities who on their own can draw in millions, when you put them all in one room well expect a bit of laid back acting. But to be fair this is what i liked about the movie, its not trying to cover up its huge ensemble cast by giving them bit parts etc, i think each character is given fair screen time, and their persona's are developed further from the first movie, this time around instead of learning about Danny Ocean (clooney) and the way his mind works, we see a lot more from Rusty's (Brad Pitt's) point of view, with even an old flame thrown in for added measure. OK so the storyline is a bit ropey, with holes all overt he place, but what good heist movie isn't a bit far fetched? Again the gang are trying to pull off a major coup in stealing millions, but this time its to pay off their last victim, Benedict (Andy Garcia). There are plenty of laughs throughout, more so then the first one in fact, but there are also a few silly moments that border on ruining the movie. All in all Ocean's 12 is another one of those sequels that can't out do the original, but unlike some sequels that totally loose the plot (Die Hard 2, Speed 2, Batman & Robin the list goes on) Oceans 12 still has enough of the first one's panache & charm to make it enjoyable, 12 maybe not the NEW 11 as the poster's say but its better then the crap out their currently (son of mask, White Noise, Ring 2 etc) ",-1.0,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,firstly lets get the niggly bits out most reviews youve read of this movie have probably been bad and the main reason for this is the smugness and arrogance displayed by the cast in having a good time making the movie you have hollywood a list celebrities who on their own can draw in millions when you put them all in one room well expect a bit of laid back acting but to be fair this is what i liked about the movie its not trying to cover up its huge ensemble cast by giving them bit parts etc i think each character is given fair screen time and their personas are developed further from the first movie this time around instead of learning about danny ocean clooney and the way his mind works we see a lot more from rustys brad pitts point of view with even an old flame thrown in for added measure ok so the storyline is a bit ropey with holes all overt he place but what good heist movie isnt a bit far fetched again the gang are trying to pull off a major coup in stealing millions but this time its to pay off their last victim benedict andy garcia there are plenty of laughs throughout more so then the first one in fact but there are also a few silly moments that border on ruining the movie all in all oceans is another one of those sequels that cant out do the original but unlike some sequels that totally loose the plot die hard speed batman robin the list goes on oceans still has enough of the first ones panache charm to make it enjoyable maybe not the new as the posters say but its better then the crap out their currently son of mask white noise ring etc

2437,-1,"I guess I'm one of the few in here that actually enjoyed seeing this film. I think that the chemistry between all the characters is what helps makes this one of the funniest films of the year. I especially loved how Tess was made part of the plot this time, even though she only appeared in a small part of the film. Also, the thing I liked about it was that it pretty much had an indy feel to it for me. It pretty much looked like Soderberg wanted to give that look to the film as a way of almost filming it as a documentary.

2438,7,"Well, despite comments by other users, I'd have to say it wasn't bad like it was made out to be. Yes the actors do look jet-lagged, but then again, wouldn't you if you new your neck was on the line and you have 2 weeks to steal some European valuables.Plus, they were all living in different parts of the nation when called back to the ""work site"". The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones wasn't necessary, but enjoyable nevertheless. In the end, I'd say the plot wasn't the most original, but what else can a movie about thieves do except steal? Its got some moments that make you laugh, and the end leaves you grinning with a sense of impossibility. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 or 4/5 stars.

They also push a little too much with Julia Roberts' part, it's a little too risky, and honestly, it does not really worked for me. It's a little incoherent at the end.

2445,8,"There are a lot of people who didn't like Ocean's Twelve. Enough so, I feel they made Ocean's Thirteen as a make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Part Temple of Doom was such a joke. Of course, using that theory, they still need to make Indy 5 for that tragedy of part IV At any rate, I'm a HUGE 2001 Ocean's Eleven fan. I've seen that movie more than a, ah hem, dozen times. This one, not as much, but I still appreciate it when I do see it. Is it anywhere close to the magic that (somewhat) part one held? No. But, it's a fun addition and original to the max. Basically, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and crew stole more than $150 million in the original movie from three Las Vegas casinos. They were set to get away with it and live happily ever after, or so people who only saw part one would count on. In this follow-up, the man they stole from, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) comes a'looking and teams up with another thief to ensure they pay back the money with interest. Playing it by ear, they cook up some European schemes to ""earn"" back the money so they don't get murdered, or worse. Despite the lack of the gorgeous Vegas backdrop, or the normality of the original, Ocean's Twelve does manage to capture the same crew with pinpoint accuracy on their individual characters and the dialogue is still incredibly rich and absolutely hilarious. I always love George Clooney and mostly love Brad Pitt – together, whether this is the original or not, they certainly deliver in the fun I watched time and again in the original. In truth, this movie is a mess at times. It's random and despite the original aspect of characters having to make up for their sins in the first movieit's still a ton of fun, funny and the cinematography and scenes are crisp and fun to look at. In truthPart Two or Twelve, honestly, I wish this movie hadn't been made. I loved them just getting away with it in the original and riding off into the sunset. Butif it had to be made, I would have strongly preferred this version. I am a fan. And I endorse this.

Yet this is what a major studio has given us. Steven Soderbergh has put together a two-hour snooze of a picture, filming some of his buddies obviously having a good time with some artsy camera shots and editing tricks designed to push along the caper movie. Instead this film never thrills and I ended up wishing I got the hell out of there at the two-thirds point. This was about the point at which Julia Roberts plays Tess plays Julia Roberts made you think that we were inside some Hollywood inside joke so inside that it made sense to those up on the screen. Add a completely pointless cameo by Bruce Willis then you kind of get the picture. Morally dubious, a waste of some good actors (Clooney, Damon, Gould), some more exposure for bad ones (why is Catherine Zeta-Jones famous?

Granted, it had all of the actors, including Catherine Zeta Jones, and a few funny/exciting scenes. But there was pretty much no suspense.

2452,7,"Director Steven Soderbergh and his all-star cast are back for another round of fun and thievery, although this time the audience is left annoyingly out of the loop for most of the film. None of the actors slack off, slipping back into their roles with the ease of a pickpocket. They all seem to be having fun; the only trouble is the audience is not informed of their game. We are left on the side of enemies Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel), and it would have been nice to be in on the con. This time around, Benedict wants his money back, threatens Ocean's crew with death, and they all get together to pull some quick heists to raise the dough. One problem: expert thief the Night Fox is playing a game of his own to steal the items before the Eleven can. All sorts of trouble ensues, with backstabbing, failing, and character flaws that are always part of a sequel. However, Soderbergh tries to use subtitles and freeze-frames with his usual stylishness, but this time they make no real sense and only seem a flashy gimmick to distract the audience from figuring anything out, which there is really no time for anyway due to the beautiful locations and lightning-quick pace of the plot. As mentioned before, the cast is back in top form, with new additions Cassel, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and uncredited cameos by Topher Grace, Brian Cox, and a special surprise Hollywood guest (in a tongue-in-cheek jab at one of the film's main characters, among many other Hollywood inside jokes most viewers will not understand.) Overall, this film is just as good as the other one, only disappointing because of its refusal to befriend the audience.

Ocean's crew also get caught up in a little contest with mysterious master thief 'Night Fox': if Ocean manages to steal a Fabergé Egg first, Night Fox will pay the 190 million dollars they owe to Benedict. What follows is a game of trying to outsmart each other: who will be the greatest thief? But as the story unfolds, the uselessness of the story is also uncovered.

2469,1,"I love Ocean's Eleven. I consider it one of the best films of our generation, possibly even of all time. George Clooney and his Croonies stole the money, the girl, and the audience in their hilarious escapade in Las Vegas. When the films grossed $183,417,150 in the US and $267,300,000 overseas, a sequel was unavoidable. If only they would've paid attention to writing a decent script. The film starts out with Benedict going to various parts of the country to warn the Ocean's 11 they have two weeks to give him his money back(with interest).

2471,6,"Walking into the theater expecting to see a mind boggling oceans 11 in Europe i was found with a movie filled with photogenic movie stars, a ridiculous crime spree and brad Pitt looking suspiciously gay. Ocneas 12 starts out showing the relationship between Interpol agent Isabel Godknowswhatherlastnameis and everybody's favorite henchman rusty Ryan. the scene tried a little hard to be funny and killed itself brutally. Skip to when Andy Garcia tracks down all of the gang. Basher who was known in oceans 11 for his funny phrases(were in barney) starts off swearing more than 50 cents . The amazing Yen is suddenly the amazing Chinese ""ganster"" and Livngston is doing god knows what in another kill its self scene. You expect the story to pick up and when they're announcing they are going to steal 3 highly valued products you get prepared for them planning then at the end somehow using the grace they did in oceans 11 pull it off. instead you get Julia Roberts playing the worst actress...herself, random OVERstreatched Bruce Willis moments, barely any Bernie mack(Frank Catton), Elliott Gould(Reuben Tishkoff) and Carl Reiner(Saul bloom). Then we get hit with some random gay acrobat from Euorpe who ""challenges the gang to a rob off and the winner gets the coveted title of BEST Thief. after that oceans 12 just takes off towards a spiraling black hole. the movie drifts so far from crime that you end up thinking you accidentally walked into 13 going on 30(or 50 in Clooney's case). it was cute in oceans 11 where you saw how well Rusty and Danny knew each other but in oceans 12 you have no friggin clue whats going on when they speak to one another. Matt Damon's character of Linus Caldwell stayed the same from oceans 11 to 12 and this movie saw a lot more of his but his role crashed and burned with a random escape with his mother. The actual robbery in this film is basically told by Danny and Tess when they visit with the euro thief man. in oceans 11 they start with the idea for the crime in the beginning, planning in the middle, and BAM great crime finish leaving you to fill in the blanks. in oceans 12 they start with the crime, completely lose sight of it, then ends leaving you thinking of what you could've bought at McDonald's with the money you just wasted. The whole i stole you stole it but i stole it first idea was poorly placed in this film. it lead you to believe that this movie was going to end big and great like oceans 11 but instead the real crime in switching bags with random man on a bus.

It came just in time, when movies start to really take themselves seriously for the Oscars, to lighten the mood. As far as a heist movie goes there have been better, the heists in Ronin, Heat and oceans eleven out shine Oceans twelve's heist, but comically this one out shines Oceans Eleven Meat the Fockers.

2474,6,"This film was a major letdown. I felt like i didn't know the characters anymore. There were a lot of mistakes in this film and they go as follows: 1. What happened to the other characters? This movie focuses mainly on the big dogs, like Danny, Tess, Rusty, and Basher. Don't get me wrong, they were great characters in the first film, but one of Ocean's Elevens most beautiful elements was the teamwork. Ocean's crew is funnier, smarter, and all out better when everyone gets involved more. 2. Not as professional and smooth. In Ocean's 11, just about everything went exactly as planned. That was another beautiful element. They knew what they wanted, who they were hitting, and how they were gonna do it. This one was just a lot of ""go with the flow"". 3. Where are the clues? In Ocean's 11 you could figure out the twists if you were smart enough before they happened because they threw in little things that you thought were just pointless sideshows when they turned out to be the most important elements of the score. In ""12"", they have to show you how stuff happened after the score was complete. ********CAUTION: POSSIBLE SPOILER**********  4. The dumbest part of the movie was when they brought Julia Roberts's career into the film. Why would you want to do that? Its hard to watch Julia Roberts pretend to be herself. That part annoyed me the most. 5. The plot. I'm not gonna give it to you (thats why you watch the movie), but it just wasn't that great. These guys just end up as a bunch of losers who lose everything they got from the first movie.The incredible feeling you get when the job is done from the first one, goes away after you've seen this.  ********OK SAFE FROM HERE ON********  6. Why did you bring back Benedict? It was over! They beat him the first time around. In this film he turns into this mean old gangster personality instead of the casino owner with some really bad luck as everyone knew him from before. He is like a different person. The only thing I did appreciate was the humor. It was the only thing that the writers did just as well as on the first one. There were some great lines and hysterical moments.

2481,-1,"No one's ever going to accuse ""Ocean's Eleven"" of aspiring to greatness - that's what made it great. It was mild-mannered, lighthearted fun with great performances, a fun soundtrack, and one hell of a heist. In other words, it worked because no one tried too hard to make it work. ""Ocean's Twelve"" sadly, seems to be the opposite: a bunch of storytellers working too hard to make something look effortless. I keep reading all these interviews with the stars of ""Ocean's Twelve"" who talk about what a great time they had making the movie. It definitely looks that way. They're funny and charming - I mean, c'mon, it's Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. These people BLEED charm. To say nothing of Matt Damon, Bernie Mac and Elliot Gould (who actually invented charm sometime before the birth of Christ). But all the charm in the world, all the winking and giggling and joking and fun you can possibly have isn't going to make up for a crappy script. Which is really what ""Ocean's Twelve"" is. So basically the guy that Danny Ocean's gang ripped off last time, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia, with little to do but fume) has tracked them all down and demanded they get him his money back or he'll have them all killed. Ocean (George Clooney) and partner in crime Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) get everyone back together to go pull a heist in Europe to pay what they owe, plus interest. The plan, at first, is to rip off an antique collector of the first-ever stock certificate. The plan goes perfectly until they get there and find that another thief, the legendary Night Fox, has gotten there ahead of them. The Night Fox leaves a note in its place challenging Ocean to a thieves' duel of sorts. If Ocean's gang wins, the Night Fox will pay their debt to Benedict. If the Night Fox wins, Ocean's gang dies. Ocean, with little choice, accepts. Meanwhile, Isabel Lahiri of Interpol (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a former lover of Rusty's and the current pursuer of the Night Fox, catches wind of the contest and resolves to catch everyone in the same net. Let the confusion begin. The brilliance of the twist in the first film was what made it great. It was genuinely unexpected, at least to me. All the fun stuff that came before that was icing - the twist was the cake. Here, there's plenty of icing, but no cake. There's a twist of course, one you see coming a mile away. It's not the same. It's like a one-night stand that was really terrific, but you try it again, and it's just not clicking. There was, however, an inspired bit involving Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts) and the part she ends up having to play in the proceedings. It's very amusing and very charming. Completely unbelievable, but it gets you a bearable twenty minutes closer to the end of the movie. Don't bother with it. It'll just make you wish for what might have been.

2486,9,"The first mistake is that the people hating this movie and giving such bad ratings, thought it would be like its prequel which explained everything to you in the end. You were thinking why Soderbergh make such a movie after a well-received prequel. It was because he thought you would think outside of the box, but most of us didn't because it gave us some explanation and we got it how they had done the heist, but in the end most of you thought the rest of the movie is sloppy and you didn't even bothered to check. First of all this is not your average heist movie, you don't know what is going on (you have a lots of why...why...why...?), the movie is not even pointing where to look (it is because there is lots of cons going on), you have to figure it by yourselves which is not possible for us normal beings, so use internet for help. Almost every character in this movie is getting conned. Every clue is right in front of you and you can see it, but you don't know what to do with it. This is because you thought this movie is about paying back Benedict's money, no it is all about (the greatest thief who have ever lived) and his Grand Plan. If you want to know more scroll down, I will tell what really is going on.  I will point you in the right direction, the rest you have to find it yourselves. See it all started with Le Marc and what he had lost (his daughter, the egg and the respect). So he set up a meeting with the 'American businessman' so that he could achieve two things, the Egg (which he already stole and made to put back) and breaking Toulour's ego being the greatest thief. Toulour was offended by Lemarc by not acknowledging him being the greatest thief, but he didn't knew Lemarc is conning him. So he broke rule #1 and talked Ocean into a heist to prove who is the best (both thought they are conning the other), but as this event is happening the Egg is already stolen, but you may ask then why are they going on with the plan and stealing a fake egg?

2490,7,"First of all, anyone who said they were confused by this film or couldn't keep up with what was being stolen must been a bit slow. (Very mild spoiler ahead) Basically, Ocean's crew try to steal something, they are out-foxed by a master thief who then sets them a challenge to see who is the best. If they win, he gives them the money to pay of Benedict who is on their tales. Not difficult to follow. (End of spoiler) OK, it's not as strong as Ocean's 11 but if you enjoyed that film then there is something for you here. It still has a pervasive sense of fun and is brilliantly shot, and the cast has become even better with some choice additions and cameos. Vincent Cassel as 'The Night Fox' puts in a great performance, and especially memorable is his dance number (don't worry, you'll see). Yes this film has a few in-jokes, yes there are a couple of obvious twists, and yes it sometimes feels like they just decided to take a holiday in Europe and film it, but it is still worth the price of your ticket.

2491,2,"I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I saw the first Ocean film and found it to be cleaver and very entertaining. This sequel had a terrible plot and was confusing. But seeing the Heist is what makes these types of films fun, and the Heist isn't really shown and only lasts a few seconds and was one of the most boring ideas I've seen. From what I could gather, the Heist occurred before the egg was even put on display. It was snatched by the thief of all thieves ( who happened to be Isabel's father) in order to prove a point to the Nightfox, another expert thief. He then allowed Ocean to make a bag switch on a train for the egg. So, the rest of the film was pointless. What I didn't get is why does Ocean allow himself and his gang to be arrested in the museum when he already knows it's a fake on display. Did he know all along that Linus's parents were cons and would get them released? Also, Bernie Mac was hardly in this, he sat in jail most of the film, so what was the point of him being there? And the whole idea of Julia Roberts pretending to be herself was silly. If that's the case, why not have Brad Pitt pretending to be Brad Pitt in order to get close to the egg. FINAL VERDICT: This film just wasn't clever. I expect to see a Heist during a heist film. And you don't get that in this. Don't waste your time with this.

2492,-1,"After the considerable success of ""Ocean's 11"" (itself a remake of a chummy Rat Pack 60's movie), Clooney and Co. returned for this flashy, but fairly empty, sequel. Set a few years after the casino heist of the original, this film has Garcia (the mark in the first caper) threatening Clooney and his gang with death unless they pay back every cent of what they stole, plus interest! (This despite the fact that he's already received an insurance settlement!) Since the eleven men have already spent more than a little of the dough from their caper, they must come up with a plan to steal even more, this time traveling to Europe. Following one unsuccessful attempt on a wealthy recluse, the team conspires to snatch a priceless Faberge egg for a fellow thief (Cassel) who has agreed to pay off their debt if they can capture the item. Unfortunately, Cassel actually makes things harder for the team as he wants to maintain his reputation as the world's premiere burglar! Things fall apart fairly quickly, forcing Clooney's wife Roberts to attempt to aid him (in one of the film's most controversial plot maneuvers.) The film alternates somewhat uncomfortably between loud, frenetic moments and languorous, quirky ones. The director is to be admired for attracting all of the original cast members for this sequel, no matter how little they are utilized in the plot (some of the actors on view have precious little to do), though they were surely compensated with lots of good times on location as noted in the press throughout filming. Clooney and Pitt still look good and provide some interesting moments and Zeta-Jones is great as the fly in their ointment, an investigator. Damon also does a fine job as the novice, trying to break through to the big time. However, there just isn't room to showcase the rest of the large supporting cast, especially with the many other billed and unbilled cameo appearances. Most of them are merely furniture in the sprawling tale. They take a back seat to showy cameos by folks like Jones and Willis. Garcia is pretty ridiculous, wielding a stick and strutting around in some bizarre get-ups. This time around, the methods and plot twists of the caper can't possibly be taken entirely seriously. It's all just too preposterous and fanciful to hold up to close scrutiny. Better to take the film as the unrepentant piece of fluff that it is and try to enjoy some of the beautiful locations, the glossy production design and the appeal of its leading players. Still, all that can only go so far in trying to put over a movie that is more than two hours long. At times it seems like Soderburgh and Clooney tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink and the whole thing starts to turn in on itself. A lot of criticism was aimed at Roberts' joke on herself near the end of the film, but the bigger question is why did she go from an elegant and stylish presence in the first film to a wan and gaunt hausfrau in this one? Perhaps it was to make her transformation more distinct visually, though, to be truthful, even then she just doesn't look as good as one might expect. Did they run out of budget for some lipstick? There are a few stylish and striking moments in the film, but overall it lacks punch and certainly emotional investment as well. Most of the potentially-tense heist sequences are relayed in flashback or otherwise awkwardly handled. It's likely destined to become a camp classic several years down the pike the way some 60's films come off now.

2499,5,"If you're looking for a light-hearted caper movie, then OCEAN'S TWELVE is nothing more – and nothing less – than that. As with the previous instalment in the series, director Steven Soderbergh goes out of the way to make this feel like a '60s movie, with a breezy tone, brisk dialogue, and sweep-along editing that carries the viewer along for some definitely light entertainment. But hey, we don't always want to watch heavy, gruelling drama, so I don't have a problem with these intentions at all. In retrospect, it was pretty easy to get this film right. It had the chance to throw off the 'remake' tag, so could follow pretty much whatever plot it wanted. All the cast came back from the original, so the camaraderie was already there from the beginning. Soderbergh's idea is to up the stakes, up the money and make things even more twisty-turny than before, and he ably succeeds at that. This film is so chock-full of crosses, double crosses, triple crosses, and surprises that half the time is spent just keeping up with what's going on. Luckily, the cast are more than watchable, although with a huge ensemble like this, it's fair to say nobody is required to 'act' very much. Matt Damon probably gives the most earnest turn, but Clooney and Pitt are just here to trade on their charm and status, and supports like Garcia and Gould barely register. Catherine Zeta Jones plays a large part and achieves some old 'movie star' charm although I never warmed to her ice-cold character. One surprise is a nice turn from Vincent Cassel, an actor I always enjoy seeing on film, and no exception here. Of course, the film isn't perfect. It takes a rather long time to get to the 'meat' of the plot and the opening introductions are long-winded and unnecessary, also rather repetitive. The film can also be accused of being self-indulgent, especially in the part where Julia Roberts's character ends up pretending to beJulia Roberts. Still, I could forgive this part thanks to the fun Bruce Willis cameo, and it all comes together for the ""pull the rug out from under you"" ending.

And of course, the actors and actresses in it are beautiful. But my largest complaint in this is the camera-work. Most of the film looks like it was filmed using a regular camcorder, not a steady-cam. This type of filming is usually reserved for documentaries or 'Cops'. I thought it was only going to be used a short amount, in the beginning when they were reintroducing the characters. However, that was not the case, and it actually gave me a headache.

The heists are almost secondary. I suspect Soderbergh was consciously trying to make a very ""Euro"" style movie. Like 60's Euro, when down and out American actors flooded Europe to make tedious intrigue dramas. The shots, the music, even the graininess of the early scenes in Rome--it all came together for me as such. It was big laugh to me. But surely the best laugh of all was the ""Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts"", bit with Bruce Willis. It was excellent.

2510,5,"Not everything Steven Soderbergh touches turns to gold. OCEAN'S ELEVEN(2001)had star power and substance and a big bang for your buck. OCEAN'S TWELVE has star power and...well star power in a movie that does not seem to deliver. Less flash. Less pizazz. This sequel finds Danny Ocean(George Clooney)in a financial dilemma. Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia), victim of the great heist a few years ago, has tracked down Danny and the gang and tells them he wants all of his money back with interest. Knowing that most members of the eleven are deeply in debt, Ocean and buddy Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt)put the crew back together and head to Europe to put together a job that will pay well and sustain Ocean's reputation. A very clever caper and stunning locals like Paris, Rome and Amsterdam still leaves this flick a bit flat.

2515,7,"I thought the movie was good, but the whole plot surrounding it I really didn't understand. Why do they care so much about Benedict? They must have known he would threaten them and if they knew that then if they were going to give in to the threats and give the money back why did they rob him in the first place? And thinking about it they didn't even steal anything in the movie, they just cheated and asked the other thief here it was. The Nightfox was actually better than them. But the characters are great, especially Brad Pitt who i actually went to see the movie for. He is just so HOT in that film, and the one before it. It was a bit too complicated though because they did stuff and i didn't know why and when and how. But you know, Brad Pitt kinda makes up for it. I still think he shouldn't have cut his hair so short though and kept it like it was in the first movie. I really don't understand who Linus's dad is though.

2516,6,"See Roger Ebert's review for a good encapsulation of the conventional take on this movie: It is less a caper movie than an amusingly satisfying riff on the genre of caper movies. The overall plot and most of the twists don't stand up to scrutiny. But it's all just used to string together very nicely done set pieces from caper movies. The fact that they are separate vignettes not connected into a completely coherent thread doesn't detract from the craft. Just don't expect a great story arc. Favorite scenes: - The establishing scenes with George Clooney at the beginning of the movie, in the bank and the jewelry shop, especially on the cell phone. - The scene with 3 of the 12 thinking up their next step, where Matt Damon briefly takes on a George Clooney tone.

I think you could almost call this a tastefull spoof of Oceans Eleven only with the same cast, spoofing themselves.

As far as I'm concerned this was the worst aspect of the movie, the acting was great not spectacular but great. I especially like the french actor, Vincent Cassel. The overall film and storyline was great, some of it was predictable some of it wasn't. There were great sequences like Vincent Cassel's laser beam part.

2520,6,"I enjoyed this not quite as much as the first one, but this was good on its' own right. They didn't try to remake the first one, but still had a similar slick caper/hidden twist sort of ending the first one had. If you've seen the first one, (as I did) it would rate an 8. However, I voted on it as if I hadn't seen the first movie, and I came up with a 6, which I posted. The reason for the downgrade is that a lot of this movie relies on things you would known by having seen the first one. Bernie Mac's character has very little to do in this movie, but the jokes made about his character relate to a scene in the first movie. (a scene that was very funny) The ""Livingston Dell"" character also has much less to do, and you don't get much of an idea what his skills are in this film. A lot of the fun with Matt Damon's character had in this movie was laid out with groundwork done in the first movie. I did really enjoy what they did with Julia Roberts in this film (her character had a bit more to do in this film), especially in the credits at the end. (at least stay around through the cast credits at the end) Catherine Zeta-Jones adds some to the film. Her character seemed suited to a more serious film, and in a more serious film would've have been interesting to expand and explore. Her character was, I think, a little too serious for this film. The motivation for the new ""villian"" in this movie was silly and felt very contrived, a knock of at least half a point. The first movie made everyone's motivations feel realistic and added the charm of it. If you have seen the first one you will enjoy this, although not as much.

2536,9,"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. The Plot: A year or so after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if Ocean's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole, he's going to call the cops. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. Also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. With many funny scenes like when Tess(Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty clever film.

2540,8,"Ocean's 12 (2004): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon: A much better film than the junk that proceeded it. After the casino heist in the first film the thieves are sought out and forced to repay back what they owe with added interest. This lands them in a competition against another thief who boasts that he is the greatest thief in the world. Structure is so more detailed and characters developed more strongly with an intelligent ending as oppose to the cheap clichés. Director Steven Soderbergh returns with the action taking place in Amsterdam. He worked with Clooney in the wretched Ocean's Eleven as well as Out of Sight. George Clooney heads the operation and struggles to outsmart his competition and remain on top. Brad Pitt also returns as his best friend who is evidently involved with an investigator played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is new casting and her appearance works as she struggles to expose the plot yet falls deeper into danger, and wrestles with her past relationship with Pitt. Julia Roberts as Clooney's wife gives a great performance where she must play herself. This provides the single funniest scenes that is backed with another familiar cameo. The players seem stronger in their self parody as oppose to just being a roll call walk of fame. The result is a pointless yet amusing entertainment.

Surely you have heard from the well respected critics that this movie is ""sly"" ""hip"" and ""cool"" because of the star power. Some of them say it is better than the 2001 film.  The star power was half the fun of the first film, granted, but the other half was a story that had twists, turns and humor. You could watch the 2001 film, think about it when it got slightly plotty, and figure it out. in the end, you had that great deep feeling you get when you see a good movie. Now, the film makers have taken the cast's ability and wrapped it inside of one of the most twisted, dull humored, and confusing heist stories of all time. You sit and watch the film wondering if they needed to have as many twists as it did. MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD During the film, there is a very important scene near the end where the gang appears to be stealing a golden egg of sorts. this egg has many fake replicas to it, so you are trying to figure out if they will get the real one or a fake one. You are also wondering if the Night Fox, who is the gang's rival stealer, is going to get the real or the fake. In preparation, Danny and the guys create a holographic image of the object, so you would suspect that they are going to take the egg and replace it with the holograph. I mean, the crew explained it that way to begin with. However, it ends with the entire gang getting arrested before they even enter the building. Tess Ocean, impersonating JULIA ROBERTS, is inside with a fake baby under her blouse. The confusion of it all prevents me from revealing what happened inside. But it turns out that the REAL EGG WAS TAKEN BEFORE ALL THE PREPARATION AND ALL OF THE SCHEEMING, AND THE ""HEIST WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! This is the grand daddy of all the confusion, and the other moments that compare to it are nearly as confusing. The ""funny"" moments throughout the film are dull and require much thinking about simple jokes that aren't even funny. I don't know If i've never hated a movie as much as I hated this one. Figuring out twists in films, especially heist films, is a fun way to get involved with your movie going. But the twists and turns in this fodder are simply ridiculous.  Please do NOT see this film. This is mean, anti-entertaining garbage that is disguised as a sequel to an excellent film.

2542,8,"Soderberg's second go-round at the sequel of a remake seems to be just a bit much. The ending of ""Ocean's Eleven"" left the viewer in suspense, alluding to a sequel. Fast forward to the time present and here we are, with a sequel too good to be true. ""Ocean's Twelve"" takes us throughout Europe in an attempt to outdo the masterpiece heist seen previously. The scenery is amazing and true to life. We see Amsterdam's famous canals and Rome's narrow streets. However, just as the scenes are foreign, as is the viewer's comprehension of this movie. The problem with this movie is that it's simply too much movie. The plot moves excessively fast for two hours give or take a few minutes, and it does not move along evenly per se. Some parts of ""Ocean's Twelve"" move too fast for the viewer to grasp, yet other sequences escalate painfully slow.  In all, the superb acting and cinematic effects are overshadowed by the plot. Yes, it's intricate, surpentine, and edge-of-your-seat, but, therein lies the problem. Twist after twist upon twist leaves the average viewer dumbfounded. Only those possessing Einstein like intelligence can grasp such plot specifics. For those fitting this category, it's an excellent movie. For the less fortunate, however, it might be best to watch the first one and leave it at that. In the end, you wonder: ""who's taking advantage of who?"" Whereas Eleven left us with a clear victor with the spoils, Twelves leaves you in suspense. Not the suspense seen at the end of the former, but a spiteful, incomplete suspense. Nonetheless, the all-star cast of actors boosts the movie's star quality. Bruce Willis' womanizing cameo is delightful, as is the special double entrendre cameo of Julia Roberts. Clooney and Pitt are excellent, and the rest of the cast hold up their end quite well. In the end, it is unfortunate that the plot and its twists are simply incomprehensible to many on the second, even third and subsequent attempt to understand it. My advice is to save your money and definitely rent it when it comes out on DVD, or hits the second chance theaters. Shall we see another sequel? Perhaps an ""Ocean's Thirteen?"" Even with such success as has been seen, it is doubtful Carl Reiner will live that long. But given the director's talent, and the feel good, high chemistry mood of the actors on set, I wouldn't put it out of the question. In all, 8 out of 10 from me.

2546,-1,"Danny Ocean has a problem. The casino boss that he and his band of thieves stole from wants his money back. Worse of all he wants it with interest, and all in two weeks. If Danny and his team want to stay alive, they have to come up with a way of getting the money to him fast, or they will be dead. Flying to Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris, Danny, Rusty and the rest of the team have to commit a series of robberies to raise the money and outdo not only their own high standards, but also their competition while all the time being watched by a sexy Interpol agent who is determined to bring them down. After the success of Oceans 11, the knives seem to have come out for Oceans 12 but I for one loved it.. This is a movie with more stars than an astrologist's convention, and with a sharp script and a glamorous location the film is always silky smooth .There is something about being a movie fan that lets you dismiss any stretch of a storyline or any leap of credibility as long as there is another celebrity guest appearance. You are simply along for a ride with some of the hottest and coolest movie stars going, and if you don't feel like a star struck groupie by the end than you are probably not putting enough salt on your popcorn. What Clooney is doing with Oceans 12 is much the same that another actor in the early eighties did when he was at the top of the Hollywood tree. Burt Reynolds was the number one movie star in the world when he made Cannonball Run. The film was not meant to win awards, but instead break box office records and let fans take in Dean Martin, Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Jackie Chan and Farrah Fawcett all in the same frame. This is what Clooney is doing, letting you in on a fun picture that is so wrapped up in a Hollywood sixties style that it just needed Burt Bacharach to throw a melody to it. In a film filled with movie stars none look more quintessentially iconic than Brad Pitt, whose clothes and sunglasses say more about his characters state of mind than any dialogue falling from his lips. Matt Damon, fresh from his Bourne Supremacy, here plays the much less intense Linus, who just wants to take leadership, while Catherine Zeta Jones is drop dead gorgeous as a Interpol agent whose interrogation you would be happy to surrender to. Unfortunately the critics have rounded on the film attacking it for the very thing that seems to set it out for, it's intense style, and blatant use of star power. True, having Julia Roberts play a woman named Tess who in turn pretends to be Julia Roberts may be a tad smug, but by then you've bought into the whole Hollywood tours vibe and the next famous face is one more to tick off on your list. Even Albert Finney makes an appearance, although Bruce Willis moonlighting as himself may have given the critics added venom to their rage. But so what?

2548,9,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Ocean's Twelve"" reunites Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his previously assembled gang of peculiar thieves, by the name of Ocean's Eleven. It seems that their ruthless victim Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) uncovered their doings and somehow all of their identities, and has a grudge against them along with an urgent threat: pay up or ship out. Thus ensues yet another ingenious scheme by Ocean's Eleven (this time around, as the title suggests, a ""twelfth member"", Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) plays a somewhat dominant (and amusing) role in the plot), to rob a prized ""golden egg"" from a European museum, once again, a seemingly infeasible task which can only be perpetrated by the most cunning, collected, suave, and industrial of minds, as this gang has proved itself to be. A romantic interest for Rusty (Brad Pitt) with the luscious, yet officious Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), as well as a new nemesis known as the Night Fox, are just some of the new developments of this splendid crime caper franchise. With a less engineered and more liberated plot structure than its predecessor, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is not quite as sensational and rewarding, lacking much of the energy and originality, as well as character structure, where the original triumphed. Whereas the first heist was an elaborate, critical operation, the museum heist is more of an intricate game, a jigsaw (even in its logic) and practically a charade with the cunning and elusive Night Fox, and there is significantly less attention devoted to the actual heist than its perplexing, yet engaging, design. Although a few of ""Ocean's Eleven"" (now Twelve) play a more ""central role"" in the action (e.g. Linus (Damon) and Tess (Roberts), many of the characters are merely around for show and hardly serve a purpose in the actual heist. And speaking of the heist, the details to the ""surprise ending"" couldn't be detected by the keenest of observers, at least until the end, which can be either be a baffling and illogical excuse for a resolution, or an exceedingly clever plot structure, that marvelously pieces together every ""invisible"" detail of the heist as an explanation to how the gang ""outfoxed"" the Night Fox. Featuring the usual industrial, meticulous, and prudent direction of Steven Soderberg, whose gritty editing translates as pure energy to an exceedingly exciting premise, some fine and jovial acting from all of the leads, adept and subtle plot structure, and a very awesome and stimulating score, ""Ocean's Twelve"", while not quite equaling its excellent predecessor, is definitely a solid piece of high octane, feel-good, debonair entertainment, and it's enticing, exhilarating, and sexy- a must-see for fans of crime caper films and great escapist fare for the holiday season! ***1/2 out of **** ",0.3333333333333333,Ocean's Twelve,tt0349903,possible spoilers oceans twelve reunites danny ocean george clooney and his previously assembled gang of peculiar thieves by the name of oceans eleven it seems that their ruthless victim terry benedict andy garcia uncovered their doings and somehow all of their identities and has a grudge against them along with an urgent threat pay up or ship out thus ensues yet another ingenious scheme by oceans eleven this time around as the title suggests a twelfth member tess ocean julia roberts plays a somewhat dominant and amusing role in the plot to rob a prized golden egg from a european museum once again a seemingly infeasible task which can only be perpetrated by the most cunning collected suave and industrial of minds as this gang has proved itself to be a romantic interest for rusty brad pitt with the luscious yet officious isabel lahiri catherine zeta jones as well as a new nemesis known as the night fox are just some of the new developments of this splendid crime caper franchise with a less engineered and more liberated plot structure than its predecessor oceans twelve is not quite as sensational and rewarding lacking much of the energy and originality as well as character structure where the original triumphed whereas the first heist was an elaborate critical operation the museum heist is more of an intricate game a jigsaw even in its logic and practically a charade with the cunning and elusive night fox and there is significantly less attention devoted to the actual heist than its perplexing yet engaging design although a few of oceans eleven now twelve play a more central role in the action e g linus damon and tess roberts many of the characters are merely around for show and hardly serve a purpose in the actual heist and speaking of the heist the details to the surprise ending couldnt be detected by the keenest of observers at least until the end which can be either be a baffling and illogical excuse for a resolution or an exceedingly clever plot structure that marvelously pieces together every invisible detail of the heist as an explanation to how the gang outfoxed the night fox featuring the usual industrial meticulous and prudent direction of steven soderberg whose gritty editing translates as pure energy to an exceedingly exciting premise some fine and jovial acting from all of the leads adept and subtle plot structure and a very awesome and stimulating score oceans twelve while not quite equaling its excellent predecessor is definitely a solid piece of high octane feel good debonair entertainment and its enticing exhilarating and sexy a must see for fans of crime caper films and great escapist fare for the holiday season out of

2553,2,"Ever seen a film with 86 endings? No? Well should the urge ever overcome you, Oceans's Twelve is the only film that refuses to just wrap up the 'plot' for good. There are about a zillion climaxes that are all anti-climatic. Steven Soderbergh couldn't even get one of them right?  Andy Garcia comes back and demands that Ocean's 11 give him back the money they stole, plus extra. So they go off to Europe to steal things by not stealing them and not really planning anything at all. The whole film is made up of narcissistic filler. Ooooohh it's all so sophisticated and cool isn't it? Puh-lease. This movie shouldn't have been made. Ocean's Eleven may have worked well but Twelve was taken from a non-related script called 'Honor Among Thieves' and adapted into a sequel, that no one asked for. So how do you go about cramming in 12 main characters into a story that did not have 12 main characters? You can't. As a result Ocean's 12 never interact all at once. Several characters are left with nothing to do, forgotten about, stand about like idiots, fight for even a couple of lines of dialogue (all sarcastic, self-aware, notionally 'cool' dialogue btw), disappear, reappear, wonder what the hell they're doing, forget who they are etc... It's just plain horrible and too convoluted and contrived for its own good. The whole film seems out of order and you are frequently left wondering what on earth is going on. This elitist, condescending attitude makes us feel like the movie was made for the cast instead of us. Plus Julia Roberts looks dreadful in this. She's very pale and thin and gaunt-looking. I thought I was looking at Skeletor to begin with. And if you don't believe how sickeningly 'clever' the film thinks it is, a certain plot development has Julia Roberts play Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts (oh stop, that's too ingenious for my feeble, average movie-goer mind). Somehow Catherine Zeta Jones comes off a prettier, if not a better actress (I do NOT like Catherine Zeta Jones-but she was an exception here when compared to the Plain Jane Julia Roberts) as her accent is still all over the place. The only good bit about the film is Vincent Cassell in a small supporting role as a master thief (like everyone else in the film). Funny how his one character is more interesting than a dozen others combined. Plus, we actually get to see him do stuff other than stand around. Which helps. Don't waste your time with this film. Life is too short and there are other, better, shorter movies than this out at the moment. Ocean's Twelve is a dirty dozen.

2559,1,"I've seen ""professional"" reviews claiming Julia Roberts playing herself was ""clever and very funny"". I think NOT. An actress playing herself? And doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at it's utmost. Why doesn't she just stand there and go, ""Me, me, me. Look at me!."" The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way Steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of ""style"". The Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good however, perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked. Once again Zeta Jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of. Sadly, this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.

2560,9,"This is one that I recently watched again and I watched it right after re-watching the first. This film stand up as a solid sequel to a great film, sure the first one (well, the re-make I should say) was the better of the three, but does that mean that this one isn't good? No, it doesn't. The story picks up some time after the first and focuses on the 11 trying to gather up money to repay their old nemesis Terry Benedict, who's still angry at them for robbing his casinos. While working in Europe, they encounter a fellow thief who wants to compete in a heist, stating that if Ocean and his team out smart him and beat him in an almost impossible heist, he would pay off their debt. I found the story to be intriguing enough and it held my interest. I enjoyed the fact that the entire cast of the first returned in this one. It seemed weird that it focused on some of the characters much less this time around, but it also focused on others more, such as Linus and the Malloy brothers which I'll admit I did enjoy. If you liked the first one with George Cloony and the gang, I highly suggest this one. Don't expect it be JUST like the first, but at the same time don't go in expecting a bomb, because this one was actually pretty good.

2561,1,"Ocean's Twelve was a waste of my time and money ($20). It was perhaps the worst movie plot I've seen in two years. Horrible! Unbelievable! The only saving grace for this film were the actors and actresses. Beautiful people in beautiful clothes and beautiful locations. If you have money, I guess you can spend it unwisely! Take my advice. Go see a different movie. This one stinks! The jet-lag from traveling to Europe should have been a part of the plot. Instead the time frame of the movie does not relate to real-world time. Catherine Zeta-Jones is, as usual, very beautiful! She played her part as best as she could until the very end. Then the plot really gets twisted. The flash-backs are distracting and unnecessary. The role Andy Garcia plays as Terry Benedict (the casino owner) doesn't use enough muscle and his role is stupid. The movie should have been renamed, ""Greed of the Rich!""

2566,8,"Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Twelve picks up where Ocean's Eleven left off and initially seems like it's going to be more of the same. That would be no bad thing, however if it was surprising that Soderbergh was willing to make a big budget mainstream movie with an all-star cast in the first place, it's even more surprising that he was willing to make a sequel to it. That is possibly why it's rather more idiosyncratic - and more divisive - than its predecessor. The story sees Ocean's Eleven antagonist Terry Benedict tracking Tess down and - wanting his money back with interest - using her to locate the various members of Danny Ocean's gang so as to force them to carry out a new heist. It has to be bigger and better than the first, which can of course be interpreted as a metaphor for the film's producers wanting Soderbergh to reunite with the cast for a sequel. It's easy to see why the film is Soderbergh's favourite of the trilogy, since it shows him at his most playful, and this is never more obvious than when Julia Roberts' Tess has to impersonate Julia Roberts. This conceit suspension of disbelief shattering subplot outraged some critics, especially since Bruce Willis turns up to give a deadpan impersonation of himself. The film's detractors accused Ocean's Twelve of feeling smug, and it does. And yet it's also enormous fun. Ocean's Eleven was decidedly tongue-in-cheek, but here there's a sense that Soderbergh can get away with more following the first film's financial and critical success. Thus, we once again get a complicated heist and once again we know that there will be a big twist, and yet the enjoyment lies in watching it all unfold. There's pleasure to be had to in simply watching Soderbergh's stylish direction: typically, he makes extensive use of fast-cuts, tracking shots and all manner of inventive camera angles, plus deep-focus shots that introduce characters in the background. The various early scenes of Benedict tracking everybody down are beautifully directed, each forming its own stylish vignette. The first heist is shown in speeded-up flashback as Isabel works out what the gang did. The whole film is slick and confident. The cast members are all as good as they were in Ocean's Eleven, oozing charisma, having fun, and getting more comic material than before, with George Clooney's Danny Ocean worrying that people think he looks fifty, Brad Pitt's Rusty verbally sparring with detective and love interest Isabel, Matt Damon's Linus being the butt of everybody's else jokes (most memorably during the scene with Robbie Coltrane in the coffee shop), and everyone generally getting a constant stream of one-liners and wise-cracks. Continuing the metaphysical theme, Don Cheadle's terrible English accent returns and is then lampooned when Basher tells Tess that her Julia Roberts accent has to be perfect. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel join the already star-studded cast; Zeta-Jones is not entirely convincing as a detective, although Cassel is excellent as a rival master thief whose bruised ego is a catalyst for much of the plot. I can see why Ocean's Twelve met with mixed reviews on its release: it tips the balance of comedy and drama in favour of the former (absurdly so at times), pokes fun at itself, and rarely boasts the thrills that kept viewers on the edge of their seats during Ocean's Eleven. There is never any doubt when watching this film that one is watching a film: Soderbergh lets us see what he is doing constantly and with apparent delight. But if you can go along with that and appreciate the spirit in which the film was made, it is hugely entertaining.

The story that is there is full of mistakes and because of that didn't make much sense to me. What really annoyed me though was the bad acting.

2568,9,"Well, I have seen this movie, and am truly surprised. After all the hype from critics about how much this movie sucks, I feel only the desire to laugh at them. In my opinion, as I am entitled, this movie was brilliantly crafted. And yes, before you get all pissy, I will explain myself. First, however, let me just say that this movie was not the first movie. I am extremely thankful for that. As I was reading the list of filming sites a few weeks ago, I was like man this is gonna suck, but be cool. (Just as the reviews, are now saying). I expected it to be a mirror image of the first in a different setting (europe). However, the fact that this was a completely different movie, with not even the same plot elements as the first, which become cliché to any heist movie, made it all the more great. What situation, could have made this movie good for you, if you weren't going to accept anything to begin with. Finally, the part that really made me enjoy this movie as artistic, and here's the spoiler. The whole deal with Julia Roberts as herself, and the cameo of Bruce Willis. Rather than a ploy to make this movie flashy, this whole matter was actually a brilliant example of ironic foreshadowing. Consider why Julia Roberts played herself? To bring Willis into the picture. And what did Willis do when he was there? He walked around, looked pretty, and talked to people. And what did those people say? Again and again, ""you know I knew what was going to happen as soon as you sat down to dinner, and she didn't talk to you"". This obviously refers to the ironic foreshadowing in the ""Sixth Sense"". The same ironic foreshadowing that was masterly placed in this film. Consider the bag, which contained the egg. The first time you saw it. The second time. The third. The fourth.

2569,5,"Ocean's Twelve further proves the point that Hollywood needs to stop making sequels. The original movie was very well done and was a great crime caper movie. I loved how the movie confused you just enough so that at the end you sat there and said, ""damn, they're good."" This movie, on the other hand, provides much confusion but you never ever say, ""damn, they're good."" Half the time you have no idea what is going on and when you think you have a grip on it the movie throws another meaningless flashback. The script of this movie falls very flat and despite the best efforts of the director to maintain the eye-popping cast of Cloony, Pitt, Damon and Roberts the movie is just plain bad. The plot had a little bit of promise with a Catch Me If You Can type thing going on between Zeta-Jones and Pitt. Also the addition of the Night Fox and the little game he plays with Ocean's twelve was a nice addition. But the problem is that the plot got really hokey really quickly. I rolled my eyes many a time at the corny dialogue and found the only amusing part to be when Pitt and Cloony talk code in front of Damon. But when the movie starts bringing in holographic eggs, laser trip sensors that need to have characters break dance across the floor, Bruce Willis in a random cameo and Julia Roberts needing to play herself for a distraction so that the 12 can steal something, the film just goes awry. Overall, the film does not live up to the charming original.

2570,9,"My meta is heart-spirited, with this sequel, however, I don't have the science to argue the point, or to actually demonstrate what that meta actually is. Curiously enough, what I've said kind of mirrors the story itself. The meta that I have. Which is heart-spirited, is that Ocean's Twelve is like the Michael Bay Transformers series and is like Quantum of Solace; all of the movies are ""we don't owe the audience"" essences. Because the state is one of imperfection, symmetry can be infinitely crossed (perhaps sound familiar), explaining why so many movies like Ocean's Twelve are predisposed to relaxation.

I can't really tell you. The movie lacks logic. My guess is the director just felt it wasn't quite complex enough, so he threw in another shocking twist. And Julia Roberts basically playing...

The film started out well enough and wasn't bad throughout but it became apparent it was aimed at the makers of the films themselves as soon as the ""pretend to be Julia Roberts"" scene started. Why this scene was written, shot and included in the film is perplexing and undermines the entire film, if they shot this sequence and watched it themselves for some laughs I could understand. The rest of the film isn't too bad but it's not at the same level as the first and large paychecks must have gotten all the cast back.

But the cleverness of Ocean's team's primary opponent stealing the egg before they had a chance to being undone by Ocean's team stealing it before he had a chance to is pretty clever. Undoing a trope by using the same trope... Everyone hates that a bunch of celebrities did a movie together (judging by the first two reviews I read lmao) but compare this to ""This Is The End"" and, c'mon, at least this celebrity ego fest is a clever ego-fest! My favorite part of the movie is when character's lines immediately contradicted themselves. Like Eddie Izzard's ""isn't it cliche to have a sexy assistant"" line right before his sexy assistant walks on screen. There were 3-4 others in there that I really enjoyed. Also they set up the Julia Roberts switcharoo quite well by grounding the in-movie universe in our world with Topher Grace playing himself. What's the line - ""never show a gun in the first act if you don't plan to use it in the third""? This film amends it to ""never show a real celebrity in the first act unless you plan to make Julia Roberts play herself in the third."" Heist films are a popular genre.

2604,5,"If you read my review for Ocean's 11 you'll much better understand this review for it's follow up. You can understand why they would all want to make a sequel and hats off to them for bringing back the entire cast including director Stephen Soderbergh, how often is that doable? As expected, or at least as I expected the follow up to a great movie in 2001 falls short in many ways. The 2001 remake was made to bring together some of Hollywood's actors and have a great time. They lost this magic doing the sequel, in fact for most of the film the cast seems downright depressed. The story picks up three years after the original. Terry Benedict has finally tracked down Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices who robbed him of 160 million dollars. Now that he's found them he wants every penny back plus interest to the tune of about 198 million dollars or he's going to kill every last one of them. So Danny and Rusty hatch a new scheme (no pun intended.) The twelve of them go to Europe in order to find a big heist to pay back Benedict. They find two of the world's master thieves and get into a competition with the one they call Nightfox. If Ocean and his men can boost a precious egg from high security before Nightfox does, Nightfox will pay their debt to Benedict. I think Soderbergh attempted to not recreate the first film and simply redo scenes using the same style but by doing that he actually lost what the original movie had. The plot was not nearly as good and much of the film was just very pointless. In the original, everyone and everything had a purpose. Every thing we as the audience saw happen, even if we thought it was an error turned out to be part of a clever and elaborate plan. In Ocean's 12 we don't even see them pull the heist and nothing they do has anything to do with the plot or plan. In the original each character had his own purpose, his own job and in the sequel, none of them had any reason to be there whatsoever. The first robbery they pull in Europe has no bearing or reason behind it. Clooney's character seems bored and rushed. The addition of Hollywood heavyweight Catherine Zeta Jones was a brilliant addition of the ex-girlfriend of Pitt's character who happens to work for Europol as a detective. She's always hot on their trails but that part of the plot is badly underused. The one thing Soderbergh did reuse and try and capture was the blend of on screen/off screen and having Julia Roberts' character Tess Ocean sneak in the museum portraying someone she looked a lot like (Julia Roberts) was a good laugh and very cheeky although rather unbelievable. Cameo's were no less brilliant in this one having the amazing Bruce Willis join in briefly, Albert Finney in a small role, and bringing back Scott Schwartz for his role as Bruiser, however briefly was humorous. The film is not an entire write off but that's mostly because it's fun to see the whole entire cast back, not letting anyone go. The plot and writing is where this film loses out but I'm not sure they could have done it any better for a film that didn't really warrant a sequel.

2605,-1,"Ocean's Twelve is one of the most tongue-in-cheek, intelligent and delightful sequels I have seen in years. I really liked Ocean's Eleven, and this movie is better. Music is perfect, performances rule, the irony is hilarious and you almost look for genius ad-libbing in some of the wonderful scenes where the Eleven engage in sarcastic banter. All the various stories work beautifully, the love story, the heist, the deception. An almost perfect blend of plot and tone. Great writing with a wink. Most sequels are a disaster. This one I could watch a hundred times. And even Elliot Gould seems to have captured some of the charm he showed in MASH.

2610,8,"The twisted and convoluted plot of this engaging film with gorgeous locations is on a par with Oceans 11 if not slightly better.  The downside is that it is slow to start but once underway Pitt, as Rusty Ryan, and Matt Damon excel themselves. It goes without saying that Clooney is as good as ever and as for Julia Roberts - you are left wondering whether it really is Julia Roberts or a stand in by the time the film ends - a neat twist. Quotations abound including the old saying ""Problems are just a possible opportunity and even the "" Do I look 50?"" quip whilst a bit trite is still quite funny. The round table scene where everyone is talking in code extempore is difficult to follow but the closing Damon comment is memorable: ""I have been a traveller in time and space which brings me here"".

2611,1,"Having not seen all of the first film, I decided to watch the second. And ended up finding myself repulsed from the screen by the sheer audacity of putting twelve famous people on screen with no plot, and letting them make a movie about how great they are. At times, I found more interest in a a leaflet for mobile phones that fell out of a magazine. It's basically a very long advert. It has the slewing camera angles, the 'cool' background music, the freeze frames at random points. It's like a documentary of how much fun these famous people have when they're put in a room together. And paid several million dollars. The Julia Roberts scene is hideously self-referential, relying on pop culture to carry itself through rather than any semblance of plot. But possibly the worst scene in any film I've seen is that of the thief Night Fox evading laser detection systems... by putting some funky French techno onto his iPod, and break dancing through the lasers. Never mind the fact that the lasers keep passing through his body, it still ranks as one of the sheer stupidest scenes in movie history. This film is smug, flashy, soulless and far, FAR too knowing for its own good. If you want a decent heist movie, watch the original Italian Job. Not this.

It took the same great cast of characters we all knew and made another really interesting film. It's hard to compare it to its predecessor, but is ultimately a great movie. It seemed to focus on some characters more than others, but still maintained a balance for the crew of twelve. It had Great Bits, Great Cameos, a lot of situational mishaps, and loads fun in my opinion. I doubt it will be as well received as the first, but I think it stands up well.

2613,4,"Ocean's Twelve is the sequel to the hit film Ocean's Eleven released in 2001. Starting into the film, it takes place where the crew flies to Europe in an attempt to pull off quick heists in order to pay off Benedict. There, they find out they are up against a mysterious character who is thwarting their plans for some unknown reason. They have to find this person and stop him before Benedict's deadline. They are also being pursued by a clever detective, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is close to arresting them. I was willing to put up with this unbelievable nonsense for a time, but my breaking point came when the film actually has Julia Roberts portraying Tess Ocean, who, in turn is portraying Julia Roberts as part of a plot to get close to a guarded treasure in a museum. I don't think this could ever work, but in order for it to have a chance, wouldn't Julia Roberts have to at least establish the character of Tess Ocean first? It ruined the film as a whole and became quite over the top and silly at this point. One of the things you need in order to have a successful heist movie is a good heist, or a good confidence scheme. Here, the big heist at the end of the movie turns out to be an afterthought. It is a throwaway heist shown as a flashback. The acting is casual, at best. The big problem is screen time. There is only enough of it for Clooney, Pitt and Matt Damon. Most of the others in the all-star cast, like Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia and Roberts, have very limited roles.

2619,-1,"Ocean's 12 is the continuation of the saga of a group of robbers, directed with finesse by Steven Soderberg. Despite being overlong, Ocean's Twelve is enjoyable, and will likely appeal to anyone who appreciated the 2001 film. Not only are the actors the same, but the men behind the scenes, including Soderbergh, producer Jerry Weintraub, and composer David Holmes, have returned for another round. The screenplay, by George Nolfi, starts out a little slow, but, by the end of the first hour, it has hit its stride with the movie building momentum. The complicated details of the final heist are entertaining to unravel, and there's also a wonderfully wry bit of fourth wall-breaking fun that Soderbergh has at Julia Roberts' expense. Soderbergh peppers the print with occasional directorial flourishes (freeze-frames, the use of colored filters, etc.), but, for the most part, he presents the film straight.

But there's a big problem. Part of the enjoyment of seeing a caper movie is seeing the thieves get a bunch of money. So here's my problem: The cast spends the first part of the movie counting up how much of the original stolen money they haven't spent so that they can give it back to Terry Benedict, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to steal just enough money to make up the difference. (Review the math and you'll see what I mean: they're trying to steal 90-plus million, but they owe Terry 160-plus million.) Huh? So, in the end, even if they are successful, they have no money left?

The screenplay is well written and keeps the characters true. The movie primarily takes place in Italy and revolves around the cast trying to payback Benedict what they stole from him plus interest. At the beginning we catch up with the 11 thieves. Linus is as neurotic as before. Frank has his own nail salon. Danny and Tess are trying to settle into a normal life. Rusty is still in the stealing business, only now he has a girlfriend who is a detective for Europool. Although, he doesn't eat as much food. This is a great film to watch over and over.

2638,1,"Big mistake making this film. Amazed the actors signed up to it. Pay checks and who's who 'A' list credits must have been the catalyst. The first half hour is a mixture of confusing snippets of different timelines and ""guess who's back?"" shots. Add to this the whispering dialogue, so you can hardly hear the actors, and you have little idea what on earth the plot is supposed to be. This film is really a plot within a plot within a plot. The half hour prior to the last fifteen minutes moves faster than the rest of the film, but it's completely pointless. In it we're shown that the remaining 'free' members of the crew decide to enlist Tess (Julia Roberts) to assist them in the heist. Here's the clanger...they come to the conclusion that Tess looks very similar to...wait for it....Julia Roberts!!! Now there's a script with originality and imagination for you. They also get Bruce Willis in a cameo role to make it more likely that the character played by Julia Roberts is really Julia Roberts. Willis seems bemused by the whole thing. Julia Roberts manages to play herself well enough (!) Clanger No.2 comes at the end. We're shown that the target of the heist (a Faberge Egg) was actually 'pinched' by Ocean's crew earlier on. It's the twist to make the audience say ""I didn't see that coming."", and it's an insult to the audience. Basically we're to believe that with the loot already in their possession, they enlist Julia Roberts to go through a pointless act to attempt to steal the fake one, so they can be locked up, only to then be rescued by associates. All so they can A) Get away with it all, and B) Have the right to boast to another top-class thief The other underlying plot issue is that they have to pay back the cash from the 1st movie. This is the basis for all this happening. Let's face it. In the real world, or even in a fictional fantasy world of crooks, they don't waste their time on one-upmanship when that kind of loot is at stake. Not do they bother to get caught to get busted out. Ludicrous! It's a who's who of the first film, and even the knuckle-dragging ape from the first movie is there, tattoos and all....but wait for it....he appears in a suit and touting a 'legal council' badge he busts one of the crew out of jail (legally I assume). Yes, like most lawyers have tattoos on their shaven heads and are 7 foot tall. Plus points? Matt Damon and Catherine Zeta-Jones seem to take their parts seriously enough to be entertaining. The rest are getting an even share of quips, gags, and smart-arsed comments. Few of them get a decent share of the dialogue or the filming to make an impact. The style, music and what not are good, but there's too much reliance on that to fill in the gaps. I think the original rat-pack and the original Ocean's 11 became a classic for a few reasons, but one was because then didn't try to do a sequel. The re-make of Ocean's 11 was quite good, simply because with the exception of the location and the target(s), the plot was completely different. They had a real chance to make it a classic, and the corporate idiots of the film industry preferred to cash in on it instead. Result? If there's ever another sequel it'll flop right out. Few will spend their cash one more time. 1/5 - and it's Matt Damon and Catherine Zeta-Jones who get the 1.

I on the other hand thought it was very funny. If you go see the movie make sure you know what you are getting into. This not a purely suspense movie. Its a throw back to the screw ball capers of the 50's and 60's. Its all about having fun and doing things with flare. The plot is very over the top and that's what makes it enjoyable.

2641,3,"From director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Out of Sight, Eric Brockovich, Traffic), the first film was an enjoyable stylish remake of the Rat Pack movie with an all star cast. I was wondering if this sequel would be just as good, and I gave it a chance, ignoring it being rated low by critics. Basicallys it has been three years since Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team of ten cohort expert thieves stole $160 million from ruthless Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and this money has been split between the crew, but they are not free of the crime yet, as the man they stole from wants it all back. Benedict tells him they have two weeks to get all the money they stole back, and with Danny bringing back Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) to get the ball rolling, they know they cannot risk a job in the U. S., so they travel to Europe. Specifically they head for Amswetrdam, and after searching for the most valuable job they are given the task to steal the priceless Coronation Egg that is going on display. So all the original team are brought back, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), Turk Malloy (Scott Caan), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) and 'The Amazing' Yen (Shaobo Qin). Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) says no to the job, but he possibly does a little something, so they are joined instead by Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who uses her striking resemblance to actress Julia Roberts (yes, they really do that) to help out. The job is made a little difficult though because Europol Detective Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is hanging around, she once had a a relationship with Rusty, and also there is a a thief stealing things at the same time called 'The Night Fox', later revealed as Baron François Toulour (Black Swan's Vincent Cassel). It comes to the robbery, and they do manage to steal the valuable egg, with the help of some hologram technology, as well as distraction and stalling towards the security, they pay back promising Benedict no more heists in Las Vegas, Danny gets his debt from Toulour back, and Rusty and Isabel rekindle their relationship. Also starring Albert Finney as Gaspar LeMarque, Eddie Izzard as Roman Nagel, The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabbé as Van Der Woude, Robbie Coltrane as Matsui, Topher Grace, and Bruce Willis as himself. It is reasonably good to see all the stars brought together again, as well as the new additions, but it is just a rehash of what we've seen before. The planning and execution of the robbery is not as interesting, the pace and editing are uneven, and the celebrity cameos are a bit pointless, it is nowhere as stylish as the predecessor, a boring and hardly watchable action crime caper.

2656,1,We just came back from watching the first half hour of this dreadful film and just couldn't't take any more and came home. It was the most disjointed and boring film we ever sat through part of. Lots of fine actors just totally wasted including a number of our favorites but they did nothing interesting at all. I'm sure it was going to eventually build up to something exciting but it was too much to sit through.It's like they got all these big names so they could sell tickets. We saw this at our clubhouse on the big screen with great sound system. Didn't hear a single laugh. We were the first to leave but as we headed to our car we saw a number of other couples coming out to head to theirs. This has to be the worst film we have seen since Blair Witch and nothing could be worse than that but this came close.

No cracks in the walls or anything?

2660,8,"After seeing this movie, which had me leaving the theatre in a very happy mood, I thought about writing a review for this site. So first I looked at the opinions of other people. And those caused me to scratch my head a lot. 'Drab European scenery'. 'All star cast just there to show off they're an all star cast'. 'Weird camera shots'. 'No plot'. 'The biggest heist is the fact that they've stolen my money'. 'Sequel, whaddayaexpect?' 'Horrible'. Etcetera. Erk. Are we talking about the same movie here? Somehow I get the impression people were thinking: well, Ocean's Eleven was about a masterful heist, so Ocean's Twelve must be about an even bigger one. Or perhaps they were expecting another Ocean's Eleven. But then it would have been called Ocean's Eleven 2, wouldn't it? Fact is, Ocean's Twelve is called Ocean's Twelve, and that might have been a subtle hint. Now, for the record, I have not seen Ocean's Eleven, so perhaps my view is a bit skewed. On the other hand, I am not burdened by the knowledge 'what happened before' and could just concentrate on the current installment instead. Short outline of the plot: somehow the victim (shady owner of a casino) of the Ocean's Eleven heist manages to locate the members of the team and threatens to kill them if they don't pay up the money they stole. With a fat interest, of course. No one has that kind money of money laying around, so the team needs another heist. But in the backs of their minds there is the nagging question: how did the owner of the casino find them all? As it turns out, while executing a small-paying robbery in Amsterdam to secure a big, fat-paying assignment (which would still not cover for the entire amount they owned, hinthint!), they were outsmarted by someone called the Night Fox, the most infamous crook alive. And it is precisely this Night Fox who, thanks to his conceited ego and careless remarks made by his mentor about who the biggest crook alive is, wants to take on Ocean's Eleven/Twelve team in a duel. Their goal: stealing a Fabergé egg. If the Night Fox wins, he will go down as the greatest crook alive. If Ocean's team wins, the Night Fox will pay the debt. Now of course the Night Fox is outfoxed, but how and where is something I'm not going to tell. If your first response to reading the above is 'Bweeach, been there, seen it', my response: ah, but have you seen how that tale is *told*? There's where the fun comes in. It's, just like the title of the movie, subtle. (And you honestly didn't expect the script to be about an even bigger heist, did you?) It's full of little plots to keep your mind occupied. The director dared to use flashbacks without a single word of explanation---you, the viewer, have to figure them out. Despite their vast technical skills, the team finds it tough to deal with the powers of the weaker sex. Despite the fact that they're thieves, they have a sort-of code of honour which they will not break; the morals of the detective out to get them all behind bars are questioned when she's shown to not be above a little two-timing herself. Quite hilarious are the scenes where Bruce Willis playing himself meets 'Tess' played by Julia Roberts who is faking to be Julia Roberts. It is not often you get to see stars taking themselves not-entirely-too-seriously, but still serious enough to realise they are playing a role in a movie. And there's lots more. All-star cast? Well, yeah. People more or less expect to see stars on the screen, don't they? Are there moments where, as one reviewer put it, a sign with 'applaud now' appears? Err, no. Except for Mrs. Zeta-Jones, who is dressed way too smartly for the detective role she is playing, they play their role, with no one really being singled out. They function as a well-oiled team with two leaders. There is no room for in-depth character development and long wow-look-at-me shots. And Mrs. Zeta-Jones is forgiven, because she is up against a team of bad guys on her own.  In the end, when the Night Fox despite his masterful aerobics is shown for the pompous ass he really is, you realise the main gist of the movie: sometimes daring heists, no matter why they are performed, are not about complex intrusions, masterful computer hacks and other tomcruisery, but about simple, sneaky plots executed to perfection leaving the other parties involved none the wiser. (Not convinced? Well, it sure made three or four men at the end of February 2005 multi-millionaires when they drove away with $70 million dollars' worth in diamonds, without a single shot being fired, from, how ironically, the airport of Amsterdam.) The story may not be one of the best ever written, but it was told with style, flair and rhythm. I was quite po'ed that I had to watch it in a crummy little theatre with chairs which were too small for me, but the movie managed to capture me sufficiently to forget about cramped arms, legs and an aching back. That, by definition, makes it 'good' to 'very good' in my book.

I was wary to see it after reading so many negative comments here at IMDb, but am I ever glad we went to see it. Some of the negative's I take exception to, were the one's that said ""nothing was stolen in this movie"" and ""the whole plot of the movie was a kid's backpack being stolen"". With much respect I would like to ask these people: Were you paying attention AT ALL? Yes, something is stolen - two very valuable something's are stolen! Were you nay sayers, per chance, a)in the bathroom, b)getting a refill on your popcorn, or c)yakking on your cell that you apparently missed some crucial moments while they were happening? The cast is superb - yes, you can tell they are friends in real life and yes, the arrogance, silliness and comfort level comes across on the screen. So what? You'd rather see a movie where you can tell the actors can't stand one another? Yes, ""Tess"" portrays ""Julia Roberts"" - but what makes it funny and tolerable is that her portrayal didn't work. Yes, there is a ""lost in translation"" moment that you wonder, what the heck? - but towards the end, you see what the point to that was; ""Danny"" and ""Rusty"" didn't want ""Linus"" to have much of a role in the big heist. Yes, there is a Frenchman who does a break dancing scene - but the break dancing is pivotal to what he is attempting to do, and the Frenchman is one of the main characters! And personally, I liked the flashback scenes. Yes, the plot is tricky, and oh my gosh, you have to actually pay attention (what a concept, huh?) to keep up with the story. The nerve of this director, to actually expect movie goers to THINK ON THEIR OWN! Are there slow moments in the movie? Yes. Are there plot twists? Yes. Are there funky camera angles? Yes. Is this a worthwhile movie to spend two hours with? Absolutely. But that's my opinion. Best advice I can give to anyone is go see the movie for yourself.

I was expecting a half decent attempt at a smart, hip, buddy, crime movie but was rewarded with a slow moving, action-less film, it's purpose clearly a vehicle to give exposure to the A list actors involved. Some of the dialogue (especially from Don Cheadle) and interaction between the characters was OK, but it just didn't go anywhere. And Julia Roberts shamelessly using her own name like that? Didn't Arnold do that in Last Action Hero? And we all know what a great flick that was. Not. When will Hollywood learn that an all star cast does not a good movie make?

I got the impression that they went into this film without any storyline what so ever and decided that 'well the first one was a success, and it has George Clooney, Brad Pitt et all in it, so it must be a success, I know we will make it up as we go along'. This film contains one of the worst sub-plots I have ever seen. Tess Ocean, she looks a bit like Julia Roberts, I know we will pretend she is her to create a diversion. That would be because it is Julia Roberts, what a terrible storyline. Rusty Ryan looked a bit like Brad Pitt, Danny Ocean looked a bit like George Clooney they could have created one mass distraction, all those Hollywood look-a-likes in the same building.

And anyone who has anything good at all to say about this movie should be smacked silly and shot in the ass. It appears there is a reliable enough resource of you types in the world to get people who make dung heaps like Ocean's 12 paid enough money to go ahead and make such a time, energy and life sucking monster for the rest of us to get fooled into seeing. You're the same idiots who laugh at all the one-liners Hollywood puts in so many movies these days. Those stupid one-liners the directors and producers think of when they say, ""Aw, lets make the audience laugh here even though what's going on is not really funny but serious."" And the audience loves them and just bursts out laughing because they're like goldfish being fed. It must be wonderful to be Julia Roberts. It must be one giant fantasy, one giant ego boosting orgasm of a life she has. Getting paid millions to pretend to look like herself. Jesus. How do I get that gig. More amazing, how do any of those actors sleep at night after raping the movie going world? I mean, lots of actors get together on screen to make crap, only it's obvious ""before"" you pay. Those movies are called Caddyshack 2, Meatballs 2, Ghostbusters 2. Grease 2 was a better movie than Ocean's 12. At least it wasn't Olivia Newton John pretending to be herself. At least it was Michelle what's-her-face pretending to try to take Olivia's place. And the worst is, after these fudge heads goof off for 2 hours of your life, after they've been paid the big bucks for purposely failing to attempt to make anything more than crap(those motherhumpers), they'll then be the same ones trying to be serious and mouth off their politics at you and expect you to listen to them because unlike the rest of us, the world will pay to see them become rich from fudge flops like Ocean's 12.

Let's summarize it very fast: It's the story of a bunch of losers, but if they lose they'll do it with style. And nevertheless in the end they win... Therefor I compare the four films, it's simply four films talking about a bunch of losers who sometimes with great luck get their winnings back. The plot is good, but a little bit too obvious. Within the first half hour I've spotted the trick with the father. And the heist, just know that the best heist are these that happen in the most discrete and subtle way. If you want to spend a good evening of movies, watch the 3 Oceans in chronological sequence. And I promise you, you'll often slap your front, thinking why are they really that stupid.

2702,8,This sequel is much more complicated than Ocean's Eleven and the plot seems to take many twists and turns. Too many I think. I have seen this is theaters a few times and the first time I walked out utterly confused as to what had just happened. I had missed points and plots that were crucial to understanding the whole story. After seeing it a second time I understood much more and because I knew what was going on I enjoyed it more.

2703,4,"Hi-tech heist thrillers about criminal masterminds out to crack ultra-sophisticated security systems to filch a fortune in either millions of dollars or objets d'art thrive or dive based on the gadgetry our heroes resort to and the suspense their efforts generate. While ""Traffic"" director Steven Soderbergh's new caper movie ""Ocean's Twelve"" (** out of ****) boasts an array of gadgets, this slick, stylist, but superficial sequel to Soderbergh's own remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" comes up woefully short on white-knuckled thrills and chills. In other words, the protagonists get off far too easy. Indeed, as the film's ads aver, the entire ""Ocean's Twelve"" cast reprise their respective roles, but this time around they perform with considerably less charm and individuality. In ""Ocean's Eleven,"" each participant possessed a unique talent that lent itself to their efforts to knock over three Las Vegas casinos in one night. Now, in ""Ocean's Twelve,"" Soderbergh gives their talents short-shrift and has them behave like a herd. Lushly produced and beautifully lensed in exotic Continental locales, principally Amsterdam and Rome, ""Ocean's Twelve"" supplements its contrived, already overcrowded narrative nonsense with two new characters. An arrogant but wily French cat burglar named ""The Night Fox"" (Vincent Cassel of ""Jefferson in Paris"") and a curvy, overzealous European female investigator (Catherine Zeta-Jones of ""Intolerable Cruelty"") make things tougher this time for George Clooney, Brad Pit, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Julia Roberts and Elliot Gould as they try to pinch a priceless Faberge egg. Overlong by about twenty minutes with endless wrap-up details, ""Ocean's Eleven"" isn't half as entertaining as Soderbergh's ""Eleven."" This plodding potboiler packs in too many false alarms, too many conveniently-staged, last-minute surprise reversals, and a shamelessly absurd celebrity cameo subplot to its rambling, improvised plot about revenge and rivalry among thieves. Ultimately, for all its glossy production values and star-laden talent, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is bland to the point of anonymity, with our heroes rarely breaking a sweat. Meaning, if you want to see a bunch of Americans loafing in Europe with no chance of anybody getting killed for their criminal ambitions, ""Ocean's Twelve"" qualifies as a leisurely way to let two hours and ten minutes elapse. ""Ocean's Twelve"" starts well, immediately putting our ensemble of protagonists together behind the proverbial 8-ball. Vegas magnate Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia of ""Confidence"") has blood in his eye after Danny Ocean (George Clooney of ""Solaris"") and his chums stole $160 million from three of his casinos. Benedict and his hostile-looking hoods catch up with the boys individually and warm them that they have two weeks to pay back the entire amount with interest. No, it doesn't matter to Benedict that the insurance companies have already made good his enormous losses. Instead, as far as Benedict is concerned, it amounts to a point of honor in the underworld. Benedict will look like an easy mark if he doesn't retaliate for what Ocean's Eleven did to him on his own turf. Initially, our heroes decide to pull their next job overseas because they are too hot stateside, so they head off to Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Ocean's second-in-command Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt of ""Troy"") has gotten himself hopelessly entangled with a skirt, undercover Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and she refuses to let anything or anyone stop her from busting Rusty. Again, the original cast doesn't get to do what they do best. Meanwhile, Soderbergh tries to pull off a gag involving Julia Roberts impersonating herself. You'll either be amused (I wasn't) or exasperated (I was) with this shoddy writing. One thing that Soderbergh and co-scenarist George Nolfi of ""Timeline"" do well is getting the heroes behind the 8-ball. They throw more obstacles at them than they did in the original. Once they have the odds totally stacked against them, Soderbergh comes up with a less than credible payoff that anybody with one eye could see through in a New York second. Good try, but no cigar. ""Ocean's Twelve"" garnered a PG-13 rating for its profanity, because nobody gets shot, smashed-up, or sexually assaulted in this so-so saga. Clearly, the tide has turned the wrong way with ""Ocean's Twelve.""

2709,-1,"I honestly did enjoy a lot of the silliness in this movie. Some of the parts were random as hell, but also they were funny. Fun. Lots of fun. But that's about it. The entire first hour felt like wading through poorly thought-out plot exposition. The overall plot is confusing, though thin, because it has large holes. Too much time is spent on developing irrelevant aspects, and then it's like the viewer is just supposed to know the stuff in between. I left feeling confused and disappointed. Now I'm not saying I wanted a heist film just like Ocean's 11, in fact I would be disappointed if that's all they did. But they tried to make this too many things that it shouldn't be. A heist film, a comedy, a revenge flick, a drama, all rolled into one. And I'm sure that sometime there's going to be a movie with all these elements that does a superb job. But this wasn't it. In addition, a lot changed in the way each actor portrayed their character. Some of that can be attributed to the effect money has on a person (maybe, like Yen's newfound exuberance and sassiness) but overall less of the real material was discernible. Instead, everyone seemed to play more of their caricature-esque aspects, making them seem less like actual people (one of the reasons the first was so appealing).

2714,-1,"Okay, I'll admit that I'm a big fan of star studded movies like Ocean's 12, especially since Catherine Zeeta-Jones makes an appearance. All she had to do is smile and she would get good reviews. George, Brad, Matt, Julia, Don, Casey, Caan, Bernie and co. come back for the long awaited sequel. Let's just say if you weren't a fan of the first movie, you'll be disappointed. They use the same kind of Hollywood wit and humor in this one. Andy Garcia's role has been cut down, which i think was a mistake, unless they are planning on a third movie, which is highly unlikely at this stage since they would end up repeating the same stuff. As expected, they finally find Rusty(Brad Pitt) a girl and of course she's the cop investigating the heist, making things more complicated. They use different angle shots for effect, which i don't think was achieved and there are more outdoor scenes this time which is a good change, but as we all know Europe doesn't quite look as glamorous as Vegas. It is good to see that there is more stealing in the sequel, but Terry Benedict wants his money back. I mean nobody's just going to let 150 million go. Which I think is the only realistic part about the movie. The cast overall did a great job on their part but were let down by a script with too many loopholes.

2723,5,"How can the director of 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic' do such a bad film? I was no fan of 'Ocean's Eleven' either, but 'Twelve' is by far worse. The film belongs to the genre of big burglary movies, but there is no credible or interesting story to follow or tell about. It's just a pretext to gather the most impressive list of stars in a major movie in the last year, and put a failure in the biography of each of them. The problem is that the story line is so broken and so confuse, that I simply did not understand the end, and worse than it - I did not even care. The brightest idea of the script is a cameo in cameo trick - you will find out when time has come, but it's too little for a genre that asks for creativity and humor.

2727,4,"When a film viewer is asked to slog through dense or convoluted dialogue, there needs to be a pay-off. Likewise for editing that challenges the viewer. An example of this is the film ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"". It is challenging to watch, but there is a pay-off at every turn---with humor or insight or both. ""Ocean's Twelve"", on the other hand, offers no rewards for perseverance, except more obfuscation and dullness. Moments in the film that might elicit a laugh or a pleasurable revelation are undermined by the editing and the plot, and rendered ineffective. It's a shame, considering all the talent involved.

After watching the first movie, I could not imagine the characters finding themselves in the situations that they got themselves into in this movie. The movie (125 minutes) seemed to drag one a bit too much. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character seemed to be too much of the knowledgeable law person, surrounded by incompetents. To me, the most comical part of the storyline was when Bruce Willis made a cameo as himself.

2752,5,"Ocean's Twelve departed from sequel tradition by completely abandoning everything that worked from the original(or, the remake of the original, as it is). This time, the smooth, professional cast of thieves comes back to stumble around like amateurs. In addition, we get Catherine Zeta-Jones as the most confidently inept corrupt detective in cinema history, and Vincent Cassel as a rival thief with incomprehensible abilities of stealth and acrobatics to rival any martial arts master, and the wounded pride of a school boy. Oh, and Julia Roberts returns in what surely must have been the most challenging role of her career. The plot from the original (remake) was full of holes, but they were forgivable holes. This time, even the motives are questionable. Would a professional thief really break the ""code"" and reveal his colleagues to one of their victims because his mentor snubbed him? Would the sinister Terry Benedict really settle for a monetary settlement from said thieves when the last time someone cheated in his casino he, ""had the bank seize his house and bankrupted his brother-in-law's tractor dealership""? The heist itself isn't nearly as fascinating this time around, mainly because there isn't one, unless you count a brief scuffle on a bus. So what is there to watch in this heist film without a heist? Well, there is the struggle of lovable young Linus as he attempts to become a criminal mastermind in his own right and move out of the shadow of both his father and Danny Ocean. There is the slightly amusing sub-plot of the Amazing Yen getting lost in a suitcase. And a goofy French thief hangs around, pestering the beleaguered gang, sort of like Katherine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"". Oh, and there's this Darth Vader sort of moment at the end that I suppose was intended to be emotionally significant, but failed utterly.

The first movie has Danny Ocean's crew pulling off an elaborate con, and when it is revealed how they pulled it off, the viewer kind of has a surprised and elated ""Eureka Moment."" In this movie, the elaborate con is so elaborate and drawn-out the viewer is looking for the solution just to get it over with. The most stinging con job pulled off in this movie is that the viewer loses his admission/rental cost!  Oh, one good thing I can say about the movie however is that the score kicks butt! There is a retro cool feel to it, and there's even a section that has a nice ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" riff in it. Great score! Crummy movie.

2757,5,"Did the all-star cast merely e-mail in their performances, or did they just co-incidentally turn up at a party together in Europe and decide to hire a cameraman to record the ""who-could-be-the-coolest contest""? Except for the breathtaking beauty of Zeta-Jones and the all too rare screen appearances of the wonderful Andy Garcia, the remaining mish-mash was dull, boring and seemingly filmed in slow-motion. Matt Damon did attempt to act, but the rest of the cast seemed to be sleep-walking. ""Ocean's 12"" lacked the passion and humor of ""11"", and was so poorly edited that one could barely follow what little story line there was. Sorry George and Brad, your feeble attempt doesn't merit more than a 5 out of 10, or 10 1/16. Besides, who could ever be as cool as Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack in the original?
