        "Review": "I love legal movies when they're good, and this is a great one. It's just twelve men in a room, talking, and yet there's a whole story that's very methodically and captivatingly revealed as the film goes on. This is a contender for Sidney Lumet's best work, and Henry Fonda has a great performance too. Excellent movie!",

        "Review": "Witness for the Prosecution is a fantastic film from Billy Wilder, and one of his best. The chemistry between Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester is phenomenal, Tyrone Power gives one of his best performances, and Marlene Dietrich shows why she was such as star. 10/10 all around.",
